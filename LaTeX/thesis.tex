	\textit{Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is an essential topic in modern games. Notably, it is a very crucial topic for independent game developers due to a low budget, where PCG can generate much content for less effort. As the importance of PCG for game development increases, researchers explore new avenues for generating high-quality content with or without human involvement. Here is where Machine Learning comes into play and extends the capabilities of PCG. Procedural Content	Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) systems can be trained on its own and evolve if they do not generate usable output and offer a broad application possibility. One promising way of using PCGML is the use as a game mechanic. Therefore, this research will address and focus on the possibilities and development process of how PCGML can be used as a game mechanic and is going to provide a firrst demonstration of its use.}\\

\chapter{Introduction}
\ac{PCG} is an essential and aspiring topic in modern games and is extensively used for decades \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}. Therefore, further research on different subjects of \ac{PCG} is necessary to provide new exciting techniques for games development. Notably, it is primarily a very crucial topic for small independent game development studios due to a low budget, where \ac{PCG} can generate much content for less effort and human resources \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}. With this in mind and according to Moore’s Law, more and more storage will be available on a \ac{PC} or console in the future, and it is getting hard to design a various range of content in a short amount of time. While gamer and players will be getting used to massive amounts of content because of big gaming companies which can establish a broad range of new content without the use of PCG, the small development teams will not keep up as smooth as the market leaders. Here is where \ac{ML} comes into play. \ac{PCG} is getting much more accessible and compelling with the help of ML which combined form the new impressive technique of \ac{PCGML} \cite{pcgml::paper}.\\
A \ac{PCGML} system opens a lot of new possibilities because it uses machine learning. For example, it can be trained on its own and evolve if they do not generate usable output \cite{pcgml::paper}. Furthermore, the system could also be trained by some designers with unique input or by a regular user with their creative input \cite{pcgml::paper}. \ac{PCGML} can be used for so many aspects of a game since it can learn from simple examples and instructions. Most current work on PCGML focuses on creating designed content like unlimited amounts of different levels \cite{pcgml::paper}. However, there are some open problems which need to be addressed to utilize the whole power of PCGML. For this reason, one of an open problem is the use of \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic which is a promising approach for evolving the overall player experience in games, which could guide the games industry and development into a new future of content acquisition \cite{pcgml::paper}.

\section{Idea}
\ac{PCGML} is a relatively new method and technique for creating different kinds of content in modern video games  for \ac{PC}, gaming consoles up to mobile devices. Most current work focuses mainly on replicating designed content to provide the player with infinite and unique variations on gameplay \cite{pcgml::paper}. Another great and innovative possible use of PCGML is its use as the central mechanic of a game, e.g., presenting the \ac{PCGML} system as an adversary or toy for the player to engage with \cite{pcgml::paper}. \\
The paradigm of using \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic is a relevant and promising topic which is not addressed by now \cite{pcgml::paper}. Therefore, it needs detailed analysis on how it could be used best in games. For example, design of mechanics could include enticing the player to generate content that is significantly similar to or different from the corpus the system was trained on, or identify content examples that are outliers or typical examples of the system \cite{pcgml::paper}. Alternatively, players could also train \ac{PCGML} systems to generate examples that possess certain qualities or fulfill specific objective functions, teaching the player to operate a model by feeding it examples that shape its output in one direction or the other \cite{pcgml::paper}. \\ 
Various design patterns can guide the development of an exemplary PCGML game mechanic system. As illustrated by \cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern}, design patterns can follow the concepts of the \ac{AI} as role-model, trainee, editable, guided, co-creator, adversary or spectacle. Every one of them provides an excellent guiding principle for designing and implementing a PCGML game mechanic.

\subsection{Advantages}
As already mentioned, PCGML can offer an unlimited amount of content when used as a content generation pipeline which is also applicable to game mechanics. In general, PCG mechanics are offering knowingly more replay value than usual game mechanics \cite{pcg::book}. However, with the help of ML, this is going to increase significantly. For example, players could play a game, e.g., ten times and experience different ways of fulfilling objectives every time due to their different behavior. In particular, players could also emerge emotional feelings for, e.g., a trainee PCGML system whereby that emotion remains throughout the whole game. Hence, this could create positive and magnificent memories for the players and thus for the game experience and the game itself.

\subsection{Challenges}
One of the leading challenges in creating a PCGML game mechanic is the design of the mechanic which should fulfill some crucial requirements of game design to offer a good player experience. As well, the machine learning part is going to be a challenging part since it might take much tweaking to get a fully working AI algorithm.

\section{Desired Goals}
It is important to note that the main idea of this master thesis is to create game mechanics which rely on the principles of PCGML rather than creating a generic PCGML game mechanic generator.\\
With this in mind, it is expected to provide a first insight into the use of \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic in modern games. The primary goal is to demonstrate the possibilities as well as the development process of game mechanics when it comes to the use of \ac{PCGML} and also how games should work when using \ac{PCGML}.\\
Additionally, there are some further questions which need to be addressed by this thesis. It should impart some theoretical and practical knowledge of PCG, ML, \ac{PCGML}, and \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic. On this account, it is desired to show how an implementation of these concepts can look like and which dependencies are given and needed for a fully working implementation. \\
Furthermore, it should provide a good overview and function as a primer for developing proprietary \ac{PCGML} game mechanics in a specific game engine or other environments. In particular, it shall be a focus on implementations in commonly used game engines since most of the independent game developers are using existing free-to-use game engines instead of creating a new engine - because that is often a long process of development. \\
A substantial goal of this work is a fully working game with \ac{PCGML} as the core game mechanic which acts as a perfect example of what is possible with this kind of functionality. It is considered to playtest the game by different kinds of people where every feedback and idea will be evaluated to increase the usability of the \ac{PCGML} game mechanics. Also, since video games, in general, are performance-heavy applications, it should cover a performance report as a point of reference for future implementations and uses. As an additional point, it should include an outlook of the opportunities of \ac{PCGML} game mechanics in future games and work, which should also function as motivation for future work in this field of research.\\
Generally speaking, it should be an overall guideline for bringing \ac{PCGML} game mechanics into a game.

\section{Proceedings}
\subsection{Approach}
As said before, one goal of this thesis shall be the support of small and independent game developers with an introduction to PCGML game mechanics in a game engine like Unreal Engine or Unity. For doing so, it is going to address all essential topics which are dependent on building PCGML game mechanics and their use in game engines. It is attempted to start with the central fields of interest like game mechanics, PCG and ML to create awareness for these topics in the beginning. Afterward, all the beforehand discussed topics shall be combined into PCGML and furthermore into PCGML game mechanics. In particular, theoretic usage is not only the most important subject which is the reason for providing at least some conceptual implementations on PCG, ML, and PCGML. The implementation of a PCGML game mechanic with subsequent playtests as an evaluation of the concepts is also a necessary matter which should complete the introduction.

\subsection{Planned Agenda}
The organization of the agenda will be broken down into two parts. The first one is a scientific-informal part about getting to know more about the foundation of \ac{PCGML} and its use as a game mechanic. Since \ac{PCGML} is a relatively new theme in game development, it focuses on topics regarding core knowledge of \ac{PCG} and \ac{ML} separately and game mechanics to act as a base for further research on \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic. Following topics shall be a part of the informal research:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Game mechanics and their use in games.
	\item Necessary and essential theory of PCG and ML which is dependent on PCGML with a constant focus on game mechanics, like types of PCG and some of the most used learning and training models of ML.
	\item The conceptual use of PCG and ML in a game engine as well as best practices, other approaches and possible issues when using PCG and ML in games and a game engine.
	\item Overview of possible game mechanics with \ac{PCGML}.
\end{itemize}
The second part of the agenda deals with the central scientific problem of this master thesis. It addresses every aspect of \ac{PCGML} and discusses how to use \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic in modern games with a focus on the maximum possible benefit for game developers. This part shall contain the following fields of research: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The theory of \ac{PCGML} and its methods in general.
	\item Research on different \ac{PCGML} implementations and practical usage possibilities in a game engine.
	\item Overview comparison of \ac{PCGML} methods regarding their use in \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic.
%	\item Comparison of \ac{PCGML} learning models.
%	\item Evaluation of \ac{PCGML} hardware and software requirements.
	\item Conceptual implementation of possible \ac{PCGML} game mechanics in a game engine and subsequent evaluation as well as a detailed comparison.
	\item Game development insights with one of the best-evaluated PCGML game mechanic as the central game mechanic of the game.
	\item Proof of concept with playtest sessions and evaluation of its feedback.
	\item Research summary with the meaning of \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic for the future of games. 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Methodological Considerations}
As important as the agenda are some methodological questions which need to be raised and answered at both research and implementation time, like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which PCGML techniques are best for a game? Alternatively, which learning and training models for PCGML have the most considerable advantage?
	\item Which programming language fits best for the use of PCGML in conjunction with a game engine? In particular, which free-to-use game engine is eligible?
	\item Is it better to use an online or offline version of PCGML? Related to performance issues, keep multithreading and requirements on hardware and software in mind.
	\item What are applicable PCGML game mechanics for games?
	\item What are appropriate evaluation criteria for the playtesting session?
\end{itemize} 


\section{Thesis Overview}
Finish and write this section afterwards the thesis is finished!

\section{Target Group}
Advanced game developers who are interested in using PCGML game mechanics in their game are the core focus of this thesis. The theoretical part assumes a basic knowledge of game design and mechanics, PCG, \ac{AI}, and ML since it will not be explained everything in detail. In particular, specific topics of PCG and ML which contribute to the use of PCGML as a game mechanic will be discussed and handled in more detail.\\
The practical part concentrates primarily on programming in different programming languages like C++ which makes it necessary for the reader to be familiar with programming. Particular algorithms used throughout the chapters will be covered in detail whereas basic algorithm knowledge is assumed. Furthermore, it does not require exceptional game development back-end skills since it addresses the use of the technique in game engines.

\chapter{Game Mechanics} \label{gameMechanicsChapter}
Starting this chapter with a quick insight into the \ac{MDA} framework which was introduced by \cite{mechanic::MDA}, helps to understand the foundation and the correlation of game mechanics in video games. In general, the MDA framework describes the division of gaming experience emergence into three dependent parts, starting with "Rules" followed by "System" and concluded with "Fun" \cite{mechanic::MDA}.  On this account, \cite{mechanic::MDA} described these fundamental parts of a game by the designs of mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. Therefore, mechanics contribute to a significant amount of gaming experience, and it needs adequately thought through mechanics because otherwise, a game will not be fun at all even if it has incredible graphics \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. Consequently, game mechanics are acting as one of the most critical roles in game design which is the reason to create awareness for this topic at the beginning of the thesis.
% one could mention the DDE framwork besides MDA \cite{mechanic::fromMdaToDde}

\section{Definition}
As already indicated, a game mechanic is a main concept with many underlying sub-concepts like dynamics, aesthetics, rules, systems, processes, procedures or data which all characterize the heart of a game besides story and technology \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. It also creates gameplay and the experience of playing a game. But besides, there is no concrete definition of what a game mechanic is. Nonetheless, there are some key concepts mentioned by different game designers which contribute to an interpretation of what a game mechanic can or shall be or do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Defines how a game is played, their objectives can be achieved or how to lose a game \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Thus, mechanics are precisely designed, detailed, specified and implemented to fulfill playability \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. 
	\item Often used to indicate the most influential and affecting aspect of a game which is also mostly referred as core mechanic \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. 
	\item Enables interaction and control of game objects and elements \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}.
	\item Is mostly hidden from the player, media-independent and easy to learn \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. For example, players are mostly aware of primary and often explained mechanics like character abilities whereby mechanics like an enemy damage model with its damage points are hidden concepts \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}.
	\item Can also be described as a meeting point for a designers question and their provided tools for answering that question by a player \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MikeStout}. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Mechanics}
It is evident that one tries to divide possible mechanics into concrete types since of their various possibilities and shared base ideas. For this purpose, \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} summarized different types of game mechanics which are mainly used in games nowadays. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} first categorized them into the following five types which are listed below with some related mechanics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Physics}: Motion and forces like gravity, shooting, fighting, jumping, moving, driving or any other kind of position change. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Internal Economy}: In general, all game elements which involve transaction like collecting, consuming, harvesting, buying, building, upgrading, risking or customizing of resources like currency, ammunition, portions, power-ups or other kinds of items. Also the use of energy, health, lives, power, points, popularity or experience and management actions for team, resources or inventory. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Progression Mechanisms}: Usually the elements or mechanisms which are controlling the players progress in the game world. For example, quests, missions, competitions, tournaments, races, challenges, levers, switches, locks, keys or unique items which allow a player to defeat an AI. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Tactical Maneuvering}: Is mainly used in strategy games but also in roleplay or simulation games and often deals with the placement of elements on a map like in chess. Mechanics are for instance internal tactics where a player gains offensive or defensive advantage, also team tactics and management of resources and buildings. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Social Interaction}: Refer to rules that govern play-acting of a player or strategic actions of forming allies to defeat bosses or other allies like in roleplay games. Further mechanics would be e.g. reward of giving gifts, inviting new friends to join the game, competition between players or in particular mechanics in a co-op game where at least two players are forced to work together to achieve an objective. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
\end{itemize}
Besides, it is possible to subdivide all prior mentioned mechanics into discrete and continuous mechanics concerning their internal values \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. For example, the internal economy is mostly discrete since it is mostly represented by an integer value because, e.g., a player cannot pick up half of a portion — either she picks up the portion entirely or not \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. In contrast, continuous mechanics make use of high precision values for accuracy and is continuously calculated throughout the game like the movement of a character \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. \\
Furthermore, every type can also be used to categorize game genres based on their average usage in games. Table \ref{GameMechanicsToGenre} shows this distinction between mechanics and genres.

However, since the overview of \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} is no universal taxonomy for game mechanics, there is another excellent approach to categorize them as described by \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Following somewhat similar types to \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}'s approach are used which also correlate to some parts described in the MDA framework:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Space}: Every game takes place in some game space or spaces \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Spaces can be continuous or discrete, consists of dimensions and can have bounded areas that may or may not be connected \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. The mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe are an excellent example of this kind of mechanics which are taking place in a discrete space. 
	\item \textbf{Time}: Contains mechanics which are using time, clocks, races or controlled time \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. A favorite example of this kind of mechanics is the game SUPERHOT \cite{game::superhot} which tweaks the time to create a unique game experience.
	\item \textbf{Objects, Attributes, States, and Actions}: A comparison between mechanics and the structural elements of a sentence reveals similarities \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Game objects represent the nouns, attributes and states are their adjectives and actions are the verbs of a game mechanic \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. This paradigm applies to most of the mechanics which enable interaction with game elements \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. 
	\item \textbf{Rules}: Combines all spaces, times, objects, actions and their consequences, constraints and the goals to form the behavior of the game \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. 
	\item \textbf{Skill}: Shifts the focus to the players and focus on their physical, mental and social skills \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. That means it includes mechanics like dexterity, coordination, memory, observation, puzzle solving, reading or fooling an opponent or coordinating with teammates \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}.

\section{Considerations with \acl{PCG} and \acl{ML}} \label{mechanicsConsiderationsPCGandML}
This chapter shall state some crucial considerations for the next chapters since \ac{PCG} and \ac{ML} game mechanics are not visible used in big game titles and therefore need particular attention on their implementation in a game. One of the good things is that there are dozens of possibilities for mechanics which should not create a big problem in coming up with new and novel ideas for new mechanics. With certainty, the focus of implementing such mechanics will lie on the introduction to the player and their ability for interactions because PCG and ML mechanics could confuse some players. Therefore, the implemented mechanics should be kept as transparent as possible if user interaction is needed instead of creating complex but novel and unusual mechanics. A good starting point is to design the mechanics as soon as the central gameplay concept is set and adhere to the design stages of concept, elaboration, and tuning during development \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}.\\
It is necessary to list some possible design flaws which need to be avoided since game mechanics shall amaze people instead of frustrate them while playing a game. In addition, a lot of detailed planning is made to come up with new extraordinary mechanics where plans about their proper introduction are missing \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. For this reason, it is relevant to address some common mistakes and their possible improvements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do not introduce all mechanics of a game as fast as possible because players need time to learn and get used to mechanics \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. For this reason, it is advisable to introduce just one mechanic at a time. 
	\item Do not introduce mechanics when the player has no time to explore them. They need time in their own pace to explore the mechanics otherwise they will not enjoy their new ability \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. 
	\item Use and create feedback loops for game mechanics otherwise players will not know what to do with them \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. For example, if someone uses a portion and there is no clear visualization for the use of it, then the player probably does not know what to use it. \\
	Introducing the concept of the basic grammar model described by \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel} shows that feedback is one of the most critical elements. This model can be applied to most of the games nowadays, and it loops the concepts of a mental model, intent, input, actual model and rules, state change and feedback \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel}. Where the mental model of a player assumes how a game works and what their intentions for the input and the actual input do, what then really happens with their input regarding applying core mechanics, concluded with feedback for their inputs \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel}. If there would be a lack of feedback, then the player could never update their mental model and cannot progress through a game. Feedback can appear in a quite simple binary or even complicated way \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel}.
	\item Besides feedback loops, do not forget to provide the player with directions for parts of the mechanic which are or could not be visible to the player \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. Further tutorials should be easily accessible if they are needed because there is nothing more frustrating to a player than being confused \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}.
	\item In particular, essential considerations for core mechanics are to provide clear rules on how to be successful, create a natural interaction but do not forget to challenge the player and provide the possibility for a natural progression of their skills \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}. Furthermore, they should adequately guide the player towards completing their in-game objectives with directions and feedback, allow players to progress from objective to objective in a natural way without the necessity of using the core mechanic and provide options besides the core mechanic \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}. 
	\item In general, the skill of a player will grow over throughout the game which means that the difficulty curve shall match the player's skill throughout a game \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}. 
	\item As described by \cite{mechanic::generateAndAdaptingMechanics} where their goal was to generate and adapt game mechanics, it is necessary that mechanics fulfill the requirements of playability to create an acceptable experience. For example, a requirement could be that it is necessary that a player can reach the end of a level or win a fight without dying. Overall, it should ensure that a game is playable to a specific given goal with that mechanic \cite{mechanic::generateAndAdaptingMechanics}.

\chapter{\acl{PCG}}
\ac{PCG} is a broad topic in the game industry which has evolved throughout the years, and much research was done and is currently going on to enhance and further explore its possibilities. Accordingly, it is a necessity to introduce general parts of PCG to understand some concepts and therefore be able to understand its further use in PCGML.

\section{Introduction}
Game content creation is an expensive task where often many designers are involved over an extended period \cite{pcg::PCGinGameIndustry}. That is where the encouragement of \ac{PCG} comes into play! It aims towards automatic game content generation which is done by different algorithms on their own with or without direct user or designer input to decrease the cost of content creation \cite{pcg::PCGinGameIndustry} \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}.\\
However, it would be too easy to come up with a standard definition on what procedurally generated content in a game defines because too many people attempted it with way too many and different approaches \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}. With this in mind, procedurally generated content seems to be a concept with fuzzy and unclear boundaries which cannot be defined precisely \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}. Nevertheless, for this thesis, content generated by PCG algorithms are seen as content or elements in a game which are affecting the gameplay, for instance, puzzles, quests, rules, dynamics, weapons, stories, terrain, maps and other similar kinds of game elements.

\subsection{Reasons to Use}
There are many reasons why PCG is a significant and rising topic in games. For this reason, \cite{pcg::inGameDesign} came up with two classifications representing the fundamental motivation behind using and researching PCG techniques.

\subsubsection{Utilization}
The first argument is utilization which is the principal argument why PCG is popular \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. It can be time-saving because it could produce more content than a human in an hour, for instance, a whole galaxy in No Man’s Sky \cite{game::noMansSky} \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. Moreover, PCG overcomes technical limitations concerning their use for devices with, e.g., limited space like mobile devices, it is expandable and has reusable code due to modularity and same field of applications \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. Lastly, it increases replayability because it can generate many similar but different instances of content \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}.

\subsubsection{Uniqueness}
The second argument why PCG is of particular importance is the uniqueness of their output \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. It offers individual experiences with, i.e., different generated content every time and creates new gameplay and interaction modes through replayability or possible player interaction. It is unpredictable which can be a thrilling fact for players but also designers, it can create bizarre content no human might think of, and it can be an inspiration of infinity because of its possibility for creating infinite various content \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}.


\subsection{Taxonomy}\label{PcgTaxonomy}
The use cases for using procedurally generated content for different kind of problems with different methods and approaches are almost unlimited. This variety of PCG possibilities made it necessary to find distinctive features and create a taxonomy of PCG to highlight the differences and similarities between approaches \cite{pcg::book}. In fact, there are two different views for a taxonomy which were described by \cite{pcg::survey} and \cite{pcg::book}. The first and initial approach was created by \cite{pcg::survey} whereas the new one derived from \cite{pcg::survey}'s taxonomy was given by \cite{pcg::book}.\\
As an initial classification, \cite{pcg::survey} extracted the following four classes by analyzing all possibilities of PCG which they could think of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Game Bit}: Basic elements of a game that do not affect the player's gameplay. For example, procedurally generated textures, sounds, trees, fire, stones, mountains or clouds. \cite{pcg::survey}
	\item \textbf{Game Space}: Represents game environments and usually consist of different game bits. One can think of, e.g., dungeons maps, whole planets with a procedurally generated terrain, lakes, rivers and many more. \cite{pcg::survey}
	\item \textbf{Game System}: Includes all game elements like ecosystems or other relations between game objects like rules or objectives. \cite{pcg::survey}
	\item \textbf{Game Scenario}: Like occurring events in games which could be, e.g., an event in a generated storyboard, the history of a character, a concept of levels or a puzzle. \cite{pcg::survey}
\end{itemize}
Whereas \cite{pcg::book} extended their view of possibilities for PCG and came up with the following 13 classes which are more focused on technical issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Online vs. Offline}: Is about runtime generated game elements or content as the player is playing the game versus predefined and or pre-generated content which is created before the start of a game \cite{pcg::book}. For instance, an interactive maze which is generated during runtime versus a procedural generated terrain which is used as the uniform environment of a game and does not affect the players playing experience in terms of a PCG process during the game.
	\item \textbf{Necessary vs Optional}: Distinguishes content which is necessary or required to reach an objective in a game and content which does not need to fulfill this or other requirements \cite{pcg::book}. For example, a puzzle could be necessary to finish the game whereas a generated texture is just an optional and cosmetic content.
	\item \textbf{Degree and Dimensions of Control}: Adds control over content generation via adjustable generator parameter or with a specific seed for a \ac{RNG}. In general, content where designers or users and players are in control over the generation space. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Generic vs Adaptive}: By means of generic content which does not take the behavior of the player into account whereas adaptive content could adapt on a players progress in the game and will be generated on top of their current progress and skills. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Stochastic vs Deterministic}: This paradigm differs content creation in a mathematical manner where deterministic algorithms will produce the same content over and over again provided that the same parameters are given whereas stochastic algorithms will create different content every time they are used. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Constructive vs. Generate-and-Test}: Addresses in one pass generated content versus generated and continuously improved content \cite{pcg::book}. Latter PCG method generates desired content as a result of continuous testing against requirements in a finite generate and test loop \cite{pcg::book}. Usually, there is some sort of AI involved in the evaluation of generate-and-test content \cite{pcg::book}. 
	\item \textbf{Automatic Generation vs Mixed Authorship}: By means of fully autonomous content generation provided by an algorithm versus generators where designers and players can change the behavior of the design process due to any kind of input and cooperate with the algorithm \cite{pcg::book}. For example, the creature creation in the game Spore \cite{game::spore} with automatically generated and user-created creatures.
\end{itemize}

\section{Development} \label{pcgDevelopment}
Developing a PCG algorithm can be tough and needs to be well-prepared. On this account, there are given some important design considerations about PCG and also a conceptual implementation of an algorithm in the next two sections.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
It is a good practice to stick to desirable and required properties when designing and developing algorithms and especially algorithms for generating content. One can quickly lose sight of crucial and influencing factors when developing a PCG algorithm with one of many various options which could lead to lousy player experience. For this reason, \cite{pcg::book} stated some of the most critical factors of an algorithm which should be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Speed}: In general, this property depends on the online versus offline class which was described in chapter \ref{PcgTaxonomy}. Equally, whether a PCG algorithm produces content during gameplay or generated it before the core game starts, it should never exceed an acceptable amount of time which is needed to generate content because otherwise, it could affect the player’s experience. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Reliability}: Some generators create content from scratch without even knowing what they should produce whereas others are capable of generating and evaluating their content due to given requirements. For this reason, it is a very crucial property if someone wants to generate dungeons or puzzles because of their necessity of being a solvable problem which makes it either possible or not to progress throughout a game whereas a tree or flower which looks weird does not break a game. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Controllability}: Is also one of the most crucial properties of PCG since it is very useful to be in control in order to specify aspects of the generated content. Mainly, this refers to the classes of degree and dimensions of control, generic, adaptive deterministic as well as mixed authorship which was described in chapter \ref{PcgTaxonomy} and also overlaps with the desired reliability property. For example, a designer or a player-adaptive algorithm should have control over parameters to specify a desired outcome. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Expressivity and Diversity}: This property speaks mostly for itself because the human brain can quickly detect and recognize patterns in various environments. That makes it a necessity to develop algorithms which can generate content with a right amount of expressivity and diversity. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Creativity and Believability}: Following up the last property, it is also necessary that an algorithm produces believable content which cannot be distinguished to human designed content. It should not be evident for the players to be able to distinguish between algorithm-generated content and entirely designed content. \cite{pcg::book}
\end{itemize}
Notably, a central component which ties expressivity, diversity, and creativity together is their essential use of different implemented RNGs. There are possibilities like using a standard RNGs or the creating of randomness via knowledge presentation, distribution altering or look-up tables \cite{pcg::book}. For this reason, it is essential to give special considerations to the randomness implementation as well to fulfill the described properties. Some of the most important techniques used with random generations are, e.g., Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise or Fractals \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}.\\
Another helpful point is to visualize the PCG for either debugging or gameplay purposes \cite{pcg::book}. For example, visualization can help to understand the output and distribution of a PCG when used for debugging. Furthermore, if PCG requires interaction with the player, then it is useful to show some visual feedback or visualization so that players can understand the consequences of their actions on the system \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. \\
Lastly, it is recommended to keep PCG algorithms simple and focus them on specific content generation tasks so that a bunch of content generators could be combined afterward \cite{pcg::book}.  Also, players should not be overwhelmed by interactive PCG systems \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}. For this reason, avoidance is possible with simple sensors which are taking care of the players' experience and furthermore adapt the system, provided that it is an online system \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}.  In general, all discussed points in chapter \ref{mechanicsConsiderationsPCGandML} should be taken in mind when implementing interactive PCG systems.

\subsection{Possibilities}
Using procedurally generated content in a game offers many possibilities as described in the last few sections. One of the most promising facts for using PCG in games is that players can experience a game in a new way each time it is played provided that it uses online systems \cite{pcg::gamasutra::tips}. For this purpose, \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity} extracted the creative facets of games where PCG can be used to create content in games. Beginning with visuals as the most prominent application where the most successful example is "SpeedTree" \cite{speedTree} which can create \ac{3D} models of trees and vegetation \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. However, also textures, every other kind of 3D or \ac{2D} models or even whole solar system as in the game "No Man's Sky" \cite{game::noMansSky} or visualizations are part of visuals \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. The next classification includes every kind of generated audio and narrative \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. Ludus also offers a vast field of possibilities where the term Ludus refers to activities under a system of rules which defines the outcome of a game \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. Also, level architecture like generated maps or generated gameplay can be found as creative facets of games \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}.\\
In general, the determining term in PCG is "content" which means that one can barely generate everything in a game \cite{pcg::book}! There is even a PCG algorithm called "Angelina" which can generate whole games \cite{pcg::angelina}.

\subsection{Conceptual Implementation}
PCG algorithms can vary from simple to very complex ones depending on the field of their application. Usually, they are algorithms which are fed with different parameters and then generate some content out of these parameters.\\
Algorithms, like used for world generation, can consist out of many details and therefore will not be addressed in this section. Instead, the development steps of an algorithm for generating complex rock structures called "Cascades" presented by \cite{nvidia::cascades} will be shown to give a quick insight in how a PCG algorithm can work.

\subsubsection{Cascades}
The simplification of \cite{nvidia::cascades}'s approach for a procedurally generated complex rock structure is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 3D texture generation where density values represent either rock or air.
	\item Take the texture and make use of the Marching Cubes algorithm to generate the actual 3D model.
	\item Use tri-planar texturing to complete the model with textures.
\end{enumerate}
A possible output of this algorithm can look like in figure \ref{cascadesFigure} depending on their used \ac{RNG} and definition of density distribution in the 3D texture.

\end{figure}

\section{Game Mechanics}
Now it comes to the most crucial part of this chapter of PCG because of its leading part in PCGML as a game mechanic — the use of PCG as a game mechanic! This chapter provides an overview of games which are using PCG as a game mechanic and some examples of possible PCG core mechanics.

\subsection{Current Games} \label{pcgMechanicGames}
Many games are using procedurally generated content in their game nowadays, but not all of them are using PCG as a game mechanic. The following sections describe three games which are using PCG as a game mechanic.

\subsubsection{Galactic Arms Race}
Initially, a research project which is a perfect example of PCG-based core mechanics in a game \cite{game::galacticArmsRace}. Galactic Arms Race is a multiplayer space shooter game in which the player needs to complete tasks and missions to progress through the game \cite{game::galacticArmsRace}. To complete tasks and missions, players need to flight around in space and try to kill enemies with different weapons. A highlight of the game is the particle weapon system which is used to defeat enemies whereas weapons are entirely generated by a PCG algorithm which uses evolutionary AI algorithms to evolve and generate new weapons \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace}. The AI in Galactic Arms Race creates and evolves weapons based upon actions, strategies, and weapons which are used the most by a player \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace} \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace::evolvingContent}. Besides, a player can possess three weapons at a time whereby new evolved weapons are continuously spawned in space and dropped by enemies, and consequently, players need to decide which weapons they want to use and thus feed the AI with information about their preferences \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace::evolvingContent}. In this case, a player functions as the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm used by the overall PCG system \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace::evolvingContent}.\\
In short, a combination of PCG algorithms and evolutionary AI algorithms produces the novel weapon system which represents the core mechanic of Galactic Arms Race.

\subsubsection{Inside a Star-Filled Sky}
Inside a Star-Filled Sky is an almost entirely procedural generated game \cite{game::insideAStarFilledSky}. The objective for a player is to progress through levels and try to reach one of the highest stages of progress to rule the leaderboard \cite{game::insideAStarFilledSky}. Players need to fight enemies, collect items, power-ups or weapons to defeat enemies and get over to the next level. Each level is generated and can represent the inside of an enemy, item or another entity in the game which gives the player an infinite choice of possibilities on how to play the game. Moreover, players can move in or out of the recursively nested levels, and every collected item or killed enemy change the random seed for generating the next level \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. Players can even move into their character to increase their power and more than 165000 simple weapon combinations are explorable due to PCG \cite{game::insideAStarFilledSky}.\\
Summarized, the core mechanic of Inside a Star-Filled Sky is heavily PCG-based and about exploring and progressing through generated levels with the help of generated weapons and items.

\subsubsection{Endless Web}
Is an entirely PCG-based game and thus uses PCG as its core mechanic \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. It is about fighting the nightmares in human dreams and rescue the trapped ones and thus releasing dreamers from their fears. The central objective of the game is to rescue six dreamers by exploring the world and make decisions on exploring new areas in the world which affects the parameters of the rescue progress and also the generation of new world parts \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. For example, if a player kills an enemy then depending on the configuration, it strengthens or weakens an associated challenge and furthermore changes the world \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}.\\
So, Endless Web's core mechanic is about manipulating the generative space where players influence the changes of the world generation with their chosen decisions on how they are playing the game \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}.

\subsubsection{Other Games}
Games like Black \& White, Diablo, Dwarf Fortress, Elite, Eve Online, Roque, Spelunky or Minecraft are other good examples which made use of PCG and related mechanics as an essential part in their game.

\subsection{Possible Core Mechanics}
There are a few possibilities and use cases for PCG as mechanics in games. As seen, some core mechanics aim at weapon creation and progressing through generated space with the help of generated or altered "helper" mechanisms. Apart from that promising ideas are also other noteworthy ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One exciting idea is about using PCG for multiplayer games as a multi-instance PCG system given by \cite{pcg::futureOfPcgInGames}. A game could use a central PCG system consisting of different and unique systems for each player, and every content generation would affect the PCG systems of other players \cite{pcg::futureOfPcgInGames}.  In that case, the core mechanic of the game would include influencing other players with each others PCG system to work towards a specific goal. For example, a use case would be a collaborative multiplayer game where each content generation causes a new content generated in the other’s player space, and they must find a way to communicate how to achieve a mutual objective \cite{pcg::futureOfPcgInGames}. 
	\item There is a lot of research done in the generation of quests as well. The research of \cite{pcg::questGenerator}introduced generated quests based on analysis of four existing \ac{MMORPG} and their quests. One could create a simulation game where players need to create random quests by doing interaction with the PCG system in order to provide an AI agent with missions which needs to be fulfilled to solve some other problems in the game and thus progress throughout the game.
	\item Another idea is to adapt existing and successful introduced game mechanics with a PCG-backend. For example, one could create a game like Tetris where the core mechanics of rotating a block generates new blocks. For example, every time the player rotates the block, the next block will be altered with evolutionary algorithms and changes their shapes to increase the difficulty. Moreover, the system could adapt its difficulty to the player's skills regarding the success or failure rate of using the new blocks to maintain an acceptable experience.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{\acl{ML}}
\ac{ML} is such a vast topic so that a detailed explanation of every type, approach, method, and model used in ML would go beyond the scope of this thesis. Therefore, the next sections will describe essential subjects of ML which can be useful to understand its further use in PCGML. \\
However, let us ask a question first: What is the difference between ML and AI and what is ML about actually? The fact is, there is no difference between ML and AI. In particular, ML developed from fields of research in AI and is thus a subset of AI. It concentrates on using mechanisms to learn from given data where data represents experience for a given problem. For instance, a famous example of machine learning is an application where the machine can distinguish between apples and pears with the help of a given dataset of features for both apples and pears \cite{ai::book}. 

\section{Types}
Machine learning consists out of three main types which all address a different kind of problem to solve and goal to achieve. One can classify types of supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning \cite{ml::book::developer}. Each of them functions as a solver to a specific task or problem where it fits best and creates the desired results.

\subsection{Supervised Learning}
This type of learning is a task-driven approach of ML \cite{ml::book::developer}. Its primary application is predicting or approximating data based on existing historical or empirical values where the answer to the problem is already known \cite{ai::book}. The previously described problem of classifying apples and pears is a problem is a supervised learning problem which is solved by predicting the specific fruit or also referred as a class \cite{ml::book::developer}. In this case, we would provide a sample set of real data with features for both fruits and classify each feature to a specific fruit. With this, the algorithm links the given features to a specific result and can predict those fruits based on a given test set \cite{ml::book::developer}. A training and test set could exist out of a bunch of pictures or other specific features described with numeric values in a table for each fruit. Hence, the reason why this is called supervised learning is that an ML algorithm is provided with data and therefore knows what to learn \cite{ai::book}.\\
Typical applications for supervised learning are, for example, image recognition and classification, spam detection, pattern detection, speech recognition, \ac{NLP}, sentiment analysis or forecasting \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.

\subsubsection{Regression}
A statistical process is the basis of this supervised learning technique where particular probability distributions of a given training data control the prediction output \cite{ml::book::developer}. In specific, a regression algorithm is processing independent and dependent variables of a given problem and build relationships between them which are furthermore used to predict the correct answers of a given unknown set \cite{ml::book::developer}. Independent variables are describing features and dependent variable the meaning or outcome of a regression problem. Usually, regression algorithms are applicable when the output values are constant prediction problems like for example, the predicted time of completion for a game level based on, e.g., the current player position \cite{ai::book}.\\
Some use cases where concepts of regression algorithms can be applied are, e.g., for imitation and prediction of a player's behavior or player preference learning \cite{ai::book}. Some popularly used algorithm for regression are the linear or polynomial regression, \ac{ANN} or \ac{SVM}. \cite{ai::book}

\subsubsection{Classification}
Addresses problems where classification transition of independent values into specific values is needed \cite{ai::book}. The famous problem of classifying and distinguish apples and pears from each other falls into this section.\\
Like regression algorithms, classification algorithms are applicable for imitation and prediction of a player's behavior, such as prediction of completion time \cite{ai::book}. However, in this case, the possible outputs are specific values or classes like slow, average or fast instead of continuous values \cite{ai::book}. Some popularly used algorithm for classification are, e.g., \ac{ANN}, decision tree, random forests, \ac{SVM}, K-nearest neighbor or ensemble learning \cite{ai::book}.

\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}
In contrast to supervised learning, the base of unsupervised learning is a data-driven approach where the algorithm has no information about the meaning or value of any sample and needs to infer it automatically \cite{ml::book::developer}. Hence, an unsupervised learning algorithm gets so-called unlabeled data without having a specific relationship to the target output and finds unknown structures and pattern in that set \cite{ai::book}. Thinking about the apples and pears example, then an algorithm would try to detect that there are two different types or classes in the dataset instead of predicting if its an apple or a pear.\\
Typical applications for unsupervised learning are object segmentation, similarity or pattern detection, automatic labeling, pre-training of supervised algorithms or pre-processing data such as data compression, noise smoothing or outlier detection \cite{ml::book::algorithms} \cite{ai::book}.

\subsubsection{Clustering}
For example, solves the previous described apples and pears problem by clustering apples and pears out of the given training set with features of both fruits. Based on the trained knowledge due to the training set, it can differentiate new and unknown samples into either apples, pears or an entirely new class \cite{ai::book}. In detail, clustering algorithms are looking for similarities between given features and values, and by doing this, they are inferring a relationship between them and thus separate specific classes \cite{ml::book::developer}.\\
Popularly used algorithms for clustering are, e.g., K-Means, neural networks or \ac{HMM}. \cite{ml::book::developer}

\subsection{\acl{RL}}
In short, \ac{RL} is a goal-oriented approach where an AI tries to reach a goal with the best strategy \cite{ml::book::developer}. RL uses so-called agents who are used to get feedback or specific states of an environment which is further used to learn and improve new decisions based on taken decisions \cite{ml::book::developer}. Inspired by the way humans and animals learn to take decisions, it aims at rewarding the algorithm for good behavior and thus leads it towards the best knowledge and output \cite{ai::book}. \\
In general, RL makes use of a bit of supervision in the form of feedback for an action executed by an agent \cite{ml::book::statistics}. Among experts, this feedback exists as the reward for actions in RL algorithms \cite{ml::book::statistics}.  The tricky part is that RL usually consists of following decisions and every chosen action — chosen out of a set of actions — by an agent is changing the environment which usually makes it difficult to train a model \cite{ml::book::statistics}. Hence, an agent executes different decisions in a loop and is looking for the highest total reward for its sequence of actions since it will always want to increase its total reward. \cite{ai::book} With this strategy, an RL algorithm is getting better and better over time in solving a specific problem until it found the best solution.\\
During the last years, RL algorithms have been used to learn an AI how to play classical games, find the best strategy to win a game, learn an AI how to walk and many other applications \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. Algorithms include neural networks, deep neural networks, Q-Learning or Markov decision process. \cite{ml::book::statistics}

\begin{comment} it doesn't make any sense to describe all learning models for machine learning if they won't be used at all?!
\section{Learning Models}
Which training models are used in ML? --> the 5 tribes of ML\\
"A Machine Learning model is a set of assumptions about the underlying nature the data to be trained for. The model is used as the basis for determining what a Machine Learning algorithm should learn. A good model, which makes accurate assumptions about the data, is necessary for the machine to give good results" \cite{ml:3}\\
each model has its pros and cons and therefore it is not useful to compare each of them without a specific problem or game mechanic problem which should be solved. furthermore, a short description about it as well as pros and cons of their usages shall be given to introduce them. (NO CITE)

supervised, can be used for either classification, prediction or preference learning tasks. \cite{ai::book}\\
In decision tree learning [67], the function f we attempt to derive uses a decision tree representation which maps attributes of data observations to their target values. The former (inputs) are represented as the nodes and the latter (outputs) are represented as the leaves of the tree. The possible values of each node (input) are represented by the various branches of that node. The goal of decision tree learning is to construct a mapping (a tree model) that predicts the value of target outputs based on a number of input attributes.\cite{ai::book}

\cite{ml::book::statistics} page 214 - 240\\
supervised; alternative and very popular set of supervised learning algorithms that can be used for either classification, prediction or preference learning tasks. is a binary linear classifier that is trained so as to maximize the margin between the training examples of the separate classes in the data (e.g., apples and pears). SVMs have been used widely for text categorization, speech recognition, image classification, and hand-written character recognition among many other areas.\cite{ai::book}\\
Similarly to ANNs, SVMs construct a hyperplane that divides the input space and represents the function f that maps between the input and the target outputs. Instead of implicitly attempting to minimize the difference between the model's actual output and the target output following the gradient of the error (as backpropagation does), SVMs construct a hyperplane that maintains the largest distance to the nearest training-data point of any other class. That distance is called a maximum-margin and its corresponding hyperplane divides the points (xi) of class with label (yi) 1 from those with label -1 in a dataset of n samples in total. \cite{ai::book}\\
They are efficient in finding solutions when dealing with large, yet sparse, datasets as they only depend on support vectors to construct hyperplanes. They also handle well large feature spaces as the learning task complexity does not depend on the dimensionality of the feature space. SVMs feature a simple convex optimization problem which can be guaranteed to converge to a single global solution. Finally, overfitting can be controlled easily through the soft margin classification approach. \cite{ai::book}

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a bio-inspired approach for computational intelligence and machine learning. An ANN is a set of interconnected processing units (named neurons) which was originally designed to model the way a biological brain—containing over $10^{11}$ neurons—processes information, operates, learns and performs in several tasks. Biological neurons have a cell body, a number of dendrites which bring information into the neuron and an axon which transmits electrochemical information outside the neuron. The artificial neuron (see Fig. 2.12) resembles the biological neuron as it has a number of inputs x (corresponding to the neuron dendrites) each with an associated weight parameter w (corresponding to the synaptic strength). It also has a processing unit that combines inputs with their corresponding weights via an inner product (weighted sum) and adds a bias (or threshold) weight b to the weighted sum as follows: $x*w+b$. This value is then fed to an activation function g (cell body) that yields the output of the neuron (corresponding to an axon terminal). ANNs are essentially simple mathematical models defining a function $f : x \rightarrow y$. \cite{ai::book}\\
core applications: pattern recogintion, robot and agent control, game-playing, decision making, gesture, speech and text recognition, medical and financial applications, affective modeling, and image recognition \cite{ai::book}\\
pro: compared to other supervised learning approaches is their capacity to approximate any continuous real-valued function given sufficiently large ANN architectures and computational resources. This capacity characterizes ANNs as universal approximators \cite{ai::book}\\

\section{Development} \label{mlDevelopment}
Developing an easy to use AI needs to be a well-structured and planned process. Especially, when using ML as a focus of interaction, it is even more important to be well-prepared. For this reason, this reason addresses some design considerations about developing user-friendly AI systems in games, as well as standard pitfalls to keep in mind and also possibilities of how to use ML algorithms in two commonly used game engines.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
Someone cannot just develop a new novel AI system and expect to create a whole new experience — it needs to have a thoughtful plan how to achieve new experience \cite{ai::gameDesign}. Firstly, it is useful to think about the MDA framework, which was described in chapter \ref{gameMechanicsChapter}, because an AI-based game is often tightly integrated into its game mechanics and therefore it is necessary to make no mistakes in the first place to fulfill playability and emerging experience \cite{ai::gameDesign}. \\
Here are some critical considerations for AI-based games described by \cite{ai::gameDesign} which are also worth noting for implementing an ML-based AI system: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item First, develop a rough design of the game system and then model the AI system upon that game system or vice versa \cite{ai::gameDesign}. In particular, for AI-based games, the AI system should support the designed core experience of the game \cite{ai::gameDesign}.
	\item An AI should provide possible exploration and allow a player to experiment with it which means it should be robust enough and not lead to game crashes or misbehavior \cite{ai::gameDesign}. 
	\item Avoid a too mechanical and unnatural player experience with an unpredictable system \cite{ai::gameDesign}.
	\item The environment of an AI-based game should be observable for an AI system which means it should be able to access states of different game entities at any time \cite{ai::gameDesign}. Consequently, game states should be described in a way so that an AI system can easily access and read it \cite{ai::book}.
	\item A system should be as accessible and transparent as possible for a player so that a player will not be overwhelmed by the system and its possibilities \cite{ai::gameDesign}. Notably, an interactive ML system as an AI system in the game could be a confusing thing for a player if it, e.g., exposes too much information \cite{ai::gameDesign}. That is of particular importance when using \ac{RL} as the backbone AI agent algorithm.
	\item Provide ways for emergent gameplay with the help of the AI system with, e.g., possible strategies which can be applied to the system \cite{ai::gameDesign}. 
\end{itemize}
Lastly, the discussed issues and considerations in chapter \ref{mechanicsConsiderationsPCGandML} also apply for the implementation of an ML-based AI agent.

\subsection{Common Pitfalls}
Following pitfalls are commonly occurring problems when implementing and training machine learning models for a specific problem.

\subsubsection{Under- and Overfitting}
ML models are used to approximate unknown output based on given training data \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. When talking about fitting, then it is referred to fit a model to a given training set and its features which are used to train the model. This set can consist of many independent variables and different entries which can create some issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Underfitting}: Happens when the training set for the model consists of too less information or independent variables \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. In that case, the model is not able to capture the dynamics of the values \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.
	\item \textbf{Overfitting}: Is exactly the opposite of underfitting. When a model is over-fitted then it is fed with too much information and variables so that it is not able to generalize the dynamic relationship of variables during the training \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, a right amount of information for the training of a machine learning model should be provided to achieve an excellent fitted model. A method to check and prevent the model from being over or under-fitted is the technique of validation such as cross-validation which helps to detect those problems \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.

\subsubsection{Curse of Dimensionality}
This problem often occurs when the training set is smaller than the number of feature variables, or also called the dimensions of a set, which are used to train a model \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. In this case, if the number of features increases then the performance of the model gets dramatically reduced \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. Possible ways to prevent and solve this problem are, e.g., a decrease of dimensions or providing more training data \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.

\subsection{Game Engine Plugins}
Indeed, all the different machine learning models or the one which applies to the game prototype of this thesis could be self-implemented. However, there are other people out there who have already implemented and improved their implementations which are a good starting point when implementing a PCGML game mechanic. As discussed at the beginning of the thesis, it is going to focus on an implementation in commonly used game engines which is the reason why to envisage the two most used free to use game engines nowadays.

\subsubsection{Unity}
Unity made an incredible effort in its research and use of machine learning in their engine in the last year \cite{unity::ml}. They recently released a beta version of an open-source ML agents plugin that enables games to train an AI with \ac{RL}, imitation learning, neuroevolution or other ML methods \cite{unity::mlGithub}. The base of the plugin is Google’s open-source ML framework TensorFlow \cite{api::tensorFlow} which is accessible via a simple-to-use Python \ac{API} \cite{unity::mlGithub}. They are also providing essential instructions and documentary for the usage of their plugin which is a promising, definite and significant advantage when implementing the PCGML game mechanic.

\subsubsection{Unreal Engine 4}
At the time of writing this section, there is no available officially announced ongoing plugin or feature development for ML in \ac{UE4}. However, there are others who were concerned about the missing feature of ML in UE4. For this reason, \cite{ue4::tensorFlowPlugin} created an open-source TensorFlow plugin for UE4 which implements a Python API accessible interface. Indeed, there are also some other plugins available via UE4's marketplace such as a Q-Learning plugin, but there do not look that promising as \cite{ue4::tensorFlowPlugin}'s TensorFlow plugin. Also, provided documentation and guidance on how to use the plugin leads it to a tolerable option besides to Unity’s ML agent plugin.

\section{Game Mechanics}
It is unclear which games used specific methods of ML for a game mechanic because there are not any research paper or published articles about, i.e., game companies who talked about using ML for their mechanics. Nevertheless, there is a research focus on AI-based games, including game mechanics which can be adapted with ML and is therefore used to come up with ideas for ML game mechanics. 

\subsection{Current Games}
Two games which use AI as a core mechanic were already described in chapter \ref{pcgMechanicGames} and are the games Endless Web and Galactic Arms Race. Both making use of a PCG and AI mixture mechanic where the AI generates new world segments based on game world states \cite{pcg::endlessWeb} or new weapons based on player preferences \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace}. These games are going to be first reference points and inspiration when implementing a PCGML game mechanic. Other games which used ML techniques as a mechanic were, e.g., Black and White and Creatures \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. 

\subsubsection{Black and White}
The player is in control and owns a creature who can be trained to do things for the player. They used techniques such as decision trees and neural networks to train and learn it the prediction of a player's action \cite{ml::gamasutra::ml} \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. In particular, the belief-desire-intention approach was used to implement the creature's behavior \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. The creature's training happens due to a player’s reaction upon the creature's executed actions which therefore follows the rules of RL where the creature would like to achieve the best total reward for its behavior \cite{ml::gamasutra::ml}.

\subsubsection{Creatures}
That is a game where players need to hatch animals and try to teach them how to behave and survive in their world \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. As well as Black and White, Creatures also used neural networks to teach and learn animals how to behave based on a player's input \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}.

\subsection{Possible Mechanics}
\cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern} introduced nine design patterns, summarized in Table \ref{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern} which illustrates ways to develop game mechanics based on AI techniques and furthermore to create AI-based games. Following sections describe some examples of possible mechanics or core mechanics with ML, based on \cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern}'s design patterns.

		\end{tabular}%
	}
	\caption{AI-based game mechanics design pattern \protect\cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern}}
	\label{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{AI as Role-Model}
For example, a game in which a player needs to follow an AI to solve quests or missions. Based on the players progress in each quest and imitation level, the AI adjusts its solution of solving the current or a new problem and provides the player with either a less competitive or harder solution and reward. Hence, player experience is adapting due to player behavior learning and predicting an appropriate difficulty level. For instance, a quest could be following or remembering the path of the AI to a treasure whereas built-in traps are crossing the way. Hypothetically, if the player cannot remember and succeed the path after, e.g., three times, then the AI shows a new and less challenging path to a less rewarding treasure.

\subsubsection{AI as Trainee}
Is one of the most promising design pattern since it revolves around teaching an AI different things whereby it fits perfectly for using ML methods. As introduced before, the games Black and White and Creatures are using precisely this kind of pattern for implementing their creature behavior. A game could use a mechanic like the same and introduce new mechanics on how to interact and use the AI agent by teaching it how to behave in specific situations. A simple idea would be a teaching game in which the player needs to educate fighters to defeat enemies. Alternatively, a tower defense game in which the player uses defense entities to teach an ML agent first target preferences.
	
\subsubsection{AI as Co-Creator}
An exciting base idea of a co-creator AI game would be a split-screen game in which the player plays on one side and the AI agent on the other side. The gameplay would be symmetrical, and everything a player does will be tried to imitate by the AI. In doing so, the player needs to do things to complete challenges whereas done actions affect the AI agents space and vice versa. For example, a challenge could be pushing a button which only exists in the space of the AI but opens, e.g., a door in the player's space. Therefore, the player would need to behave in a specific manner to lead the AI towards the button to progress through the game.

\chapter{\acl{PCGML}}
A purpose for research in AI-based PCG methods like PCGML was to invent algorithms which are able to create and generate content of the same type and style based on existing content with or without human involvement \cite{ai::book} \cite{pcgml::paper}. In general, \cite{pcgml::paper} defined PCGML as "the generation of game content using machine learning models trained on existing content". \\
On this account, different research was and is going on to generate music, sound effects, images, textures, worlds or levels \cite{ai::book}. Research showed that ML-based PCG methods are working well for music and images types but are facing some issues when it comes to world or level generation because of its necessity of playability to create an experience \cite{ai::book}. Thus, the generation of gameplay connected game content pointed out some challenges which further research is going to address and try to solve \cite{ai::book}. It is for this reason why PCGML approaches were not used in games yet. Another reason is that there is often not enough game content available to train a PCGML model on for a specific content generation problem \cite{ai::book}. \\
The next chapters introduce the difference to usual PCG, use cases of PCGML and some developmental features used in other research. Overall, this chapter is not going into many details since all essential cornerstones of PCGML where discussed and introduced in the previous chapters.

\section{Difference to \acl{PCG}}
What usual PCG and PCGML have in common are their hand-made algorithms, parameters, and constraints made by developers \cite{pcgml::paper}. Typically, designers would use existing game data and content to get inspired by and create generators which can generate new material on top of that inspiration whereas PCGML itself can get inspired by existing data to develop new content and thus assist the designer \cite{pcgml::paper}. So, the basic idea is to train the PCGML model on various game content and produce new content \cite{pcgml::paper}. \\
In contrast, different PCG algorithms might use ML for evaluation, but their content generation process entirely relies on their specific domain space rather than a trained model space \cite{pcgml::paper}. For example, experience-driven PCG relies on models of player experience whereas PCGML models can use preference or behavior learning to create new content \cite{pcgml::paper}.

\section{Use Cases}
The focus of PCGML is to generate new content based on training with existing content. For this reason, PCGML can be used mainly for adaption, reparation, evaluation, critique or analysis of new content but also for general PCG tasks like autonomous generation, co-creative, and mixed design or data compression \cite{pcgml::paper}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Autonomous Generation}: Is one of the primary applications for PCGML because it can generate game content without human input which is especially useful when online content generation is needed \cite{pcgml::paper}. Also, a designer could create, e.g. a set of levels and feed the model with these models in order to create new and novel but similar levels with the help of the PCGML system \cite{pcgml::paper}.
	\item \textbf{Co-creative and Mixed-initiative Design}: This use case focuses on the collaboration between designers and the PCGML algorithm \cite{pcgml::paper}. For instance, the algorithm could generate new content based on existing provided content as a draft for the designer who could polish and finish the drafted content afterwards.
	\item \textbf{Data Compression}: PCGML offers significant potential for data compression with the help of ML. By extracting specific dimensions of game content can save data size and would allow more efficient storage \cite{pcgml::paper}.
	\item \textbf{Recognition}: This is where PCGML stand out from the usual PCG algorithms. Its capability use of recognition makes it possible to analyze, evaluate, adapt, critique or repair either existing, new designed, player created or algorithm generated game content \cite{pcgml::paper}. 
	\item \textbf{Repair}: In particular, reparation of a designed or generated content can be a useful tool. For example, during generation or learning time, the algorithm could check for, e.g. playability of a level and repair it immediately or suggest a fix \cite{pcgml::paper}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Development}
There are no specific development considerations to make when someone uses the combination of PCG and ML. Instead, every design consideration, possible issue, pitfall and best practices described and discussed in chapters \ref{pcgDevelopment} and \ref{mlDevelopment} will apply when implementing PCGML algorithms.\\
Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that commonly used training models for research purposes, e.g., by \cite{pcgml::paper}, were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Neural networks like \ac{ANN}, \ac{CNN} or \ac{LSTM} networks
	\item Markov models such as n-grams or multi-dimensional Markov chains
	\item Bayes models
	\item Autoencoders
	\item Clustering
	\item Matrix factorization
\end{itemize}
