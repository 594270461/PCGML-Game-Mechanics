\chapter{Introduction}
\ac{PCG} is an essential and aspiring topic in modern games and is extensively used for decades \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}. Therefore, further research on different subjects of \ac{PCG} is necessary to provide new techniques for games development. Notably, it is primarily a very crucial topic for small independent game development studios due to a low budget, where \ac{PCG} can generate much content for less effort and human resources \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}. For example, it can be a difficult task to design and develop a broad range of content in a short amount of time and a small team. With this in mind and according to Moore’s Law, more and more storage will be available on a gaming system in the future and thus will offer game developers more space for content. While gamers and players will be getting used to massive amounts of content because of big gaming companies which can establish a broad range of new content without the use of PCG, the small development teams will not keep up as smooth as the market leaders. Here is where \ac{ML} comes into play. \ac{PCG} is getting much more accessible and compelling with the help of ML which combined form the new technique of \ac{PCGML} \cite{pcgml::paper}.\\
The critical advantage of PCGML over PCG is that standard PCG techniques need to be finetuned or even explicitly designed for specific generation tasks, while PCGML techniques aim at designing general PCG algorithms that can generate a large class of content by just seeing data via ML. Therefore, a \ac{PCGML} system opens a lot of new possibilities because it makes use of ML. For example, it can be trained on its own and evolve if they do not generate usable output \cite{pcgml::paper}. Furthermore, the system could also be trained by some designers with unique input or by a regular user with their creative input \cite{pcgml::paper}. \ac{PCGML} can be used for many aspects of a game since it can learn from simple examples and existing domains. Most current work on PCGML focuses on creating designed content like unlimited amounts of different levels \cite{pcgml::paper}. However, there are some open problems which need to be addressed to utilize the whole power of PCGML, and one of the open problems is about the use of PCGML as a game mechanic \cite{pcgml::paper}. In particular, this research problem is very promising for, e.g., evolving the overall player experience in games, which could enhance the future of player experience development.

\section{Idea}
\ac{PCGML} is a relatively new method and technique for creating different kinds of content in modern video games, and most current work focuses mainly on replicating designed content to provide the player with infinite and unique variations on gameplay \cite{pcgml::paper}. In general, \cite{pcgml::paper} defined PCGML as ''the generation of game content using ML models trained on existing content''. \\
Another possible innovative use of PCGML is its use as the central mechanic of a game, e.g., presenting the PCGML system as an adversary or toy for the player to engage with  \cite{pcgml::paper}. However, the promising paradigm of using PCGML as a game mechanic is an open and unexplored research problem \cite{pcgml::paper}. On this account, the main idea to pursue in this thesis is to explore the possibilities in the use of PCGML as a game mechanic. \\
With this in mind, it needs detailed analysis on how it could be used best in games. For example, a design of mechanics could include enticing the player to generate content that is significantly similar to or different from the corpus the system was trained on, or identify content examples that are outliers or typical examples of the system \cite{pcgml::paper}. Alternatively, players could also train \ac{PCGML} systems to generate examples that possess certain qualities or fulfill specific objective functions, teaching the player to operate a model by feeding it examples that shape its output in one direction or the other \cite{pcgml::paper}. \\ 
Various design patterns can guide the development of an exemplary PCGML game mechanic system. As illustrated by \cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern}, design patterns can follow the concepts of the \ac{AI} as visualized, role-model, trainee, editable, guided, co-creator, adversary, villain or spectacle. Every one of them provides an excellent guiding principle for designing and implementing a PCGML game mechanic.

\subsection{Advantages}
As already mentioned, PCGML can offer an unlimited amount of content when used as a content generation pipeline which is also applicable to game mechanics. In general, PCG mechanics are offering knowingly more replay value than usual game mechanics \cite{pcg::book}. However, this is going to increase significantly and offers more flexibility with the help of ML by, e.g., behavior learning where a player could replay a game with a different behavior which would lead to different events in the game.\\
Another advantage offers the use of preference learning for, e.g., a difficulty adaption system in combat between player and the PCGML system. In that scenario, the system could work against the player’s preference of using, e.g., a specific weapon and counter-attack with a defensive advantage and therefore can increase or decrease its difficulty on demand.\\
In particular, a player could also experience an emotional connection with, e.g., a trainee-based PCGML system that needs to be taken care of by hatching, raising and training it throughout the game. This effect of emotional attachment to software is known as the "Tamagotchi-Effect" which has arisen from the famous pet hatching game Tamagotchi \cite{intro::tamagotchiEffect}. Hence, a system like that can enhance positive and magnificent memories for the players and thus for the game experience and the game itself.

\subsection{Challenges}
One of the leading challenges in creating a PCGML game mechanic is the design of the mechanic which should fulfill some crucial requirements of game design to offer a good player experience. As well, the machine learning part is going to be a challenging part since it might take much tweaking to get a fully working AI algorithm.

\section{Desired Goals}
It is important to note that the main idea of this master thesis is to create game mechanics which rely on the principles of PCGML rather than creating a generic PCGML game mechanic generator.\\
With this in mind, it is expected to provide a first insight into the use of \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic in modern games. The primary goal is to demonstrate the possibilities as well as the development process of game mechanics when it comes to the use of \ac{PCGML} and also how games should work when using \ac{PCGML}.\\
Additionally, there are some further questions which need to be addressed by this thesis. It should impart some theoretical and practical knowledge of PCG, ML, \ac{PCGML}, and \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic. On this account, it is desired to show how an implementation of these concepts can look like and which dependencies are given and needed for a fully working implementation. \\
Furthermore, it should provide a good overview and function as a primer for developing proprietary \ac{PCGML} game mechanics in a specific game engine or other environments. In particular, it shall be a focus on implementations in commonly used game engines since most of the independent game developers are using existing free-to-use game engines instead of creating a new engine - because that is often a long process of development. \\
A substantial goal of this work is a fully working game prototype with \ac{PCGML} as the core game mechanic which acts as a perfect example of what is possible with this kind of functionality. It is considered to playtest the game by different kinds of people where every feedback and idea will be evaluated to increase the usability of the \ac{PCGML} game mechanics. Also, since video games, in general, are performance-heavy applications, it should cover a performance report as a point of reference for future implementations and uses. As an additional point, it should include an outlook of the opportunities of \ac{PCGML} game mechanics in future games and work, which should also function as motivation for future work in this field of research.\\
Generally speaking, it should be an overall guideline for bringing \ac{PCGML} game mechanics into a game.

\section{Approach}
As mentioned before, one goal of this thesis shall be the support of small and independent game developers with an introduction to PCGML game mechanics in a game engine like Unreal Engine or Unity. For doing so, it is going to address all essential topics which are dependent on building PCGML game mechanics and their use in game engines. For this reason, the planned agenda to approach the use of PCGML as a mechanic will be broken down into two parts. The first one is a scientific-informal part about getting to know more about the foundations of \ac{PCGML} and its use as a game mechanic. Since \ac{PCGML} is a relatively new subject in game development, it focuses on topics regarding central fields of interest in \ac{PCG} and \ac{ML} separately and game mechanics to act as a base for further research on \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic and to create awareness for these topics in the beginning. Following topics shall be a part of the informal research:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Game mechanics and their use in games.
	\item Necessary and essential theory of PCG and ML which is dependent on PCGML with a constant focus on game mechanics, like types of PCG and some of the most used learning and training models of ML.
	\item The conceptual use of PCG and ML in a game engine as well as best practices, other approaches and possible issues when using PCG and ML in games and a game engine.
\end{itemize}
Afterward, all the beforehand discussed topics shall be combined into PCGML and furthermore into PCGML game mechanics. Therefore, the second part of the research agenda deals with the central scientific problem of this master thesis. It addresses every aspect of \ac{PCGML} and discusses how to use \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic in modern games with a focus on the maximum possible benefit for game developers. This part shall contain the following fields of research: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item The theory of \ac{PCGML} and its methods in general.
	\item Research on different \ac{PCGML} implementations and practical usage possibilities in a game engine.
	%\item Overview comparison of \ac{PCGML} methods regarding their use in \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic.
	\item Overview of possible game mechanics with \ac{PCGML}.
	\item Conceptual implementation of possible \ac{PCGML} game mechanics in a game engine and subsequent evaluation as well as a detailed comparison.
	%	\item Comparison of \ac{PCGML} learning models.
	%	\item Evaluation of \ac{PCGML} hardware and software requirements.
	\item Game development insights with one of the best-evaluated PCGML game mechanic as the central game mechanic of the game.
	\item Proof of concept with playtest sessions and evaluation of its feedback.
	\item Research summary with the meaning of \ac{PCGML} as a game mechanic for the future of games. 
\end{itemize}
However, as necessary as a well-prepared agenda are some methodological questions which need to be raised and answered at both research and implementation time, like:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Which free-to-use game engine is eligible for PCGML game mechanics?
	\item What are applicable PCGML game mechanics for games?
	\item What are appropriate evaluation criteria? 
\end{itemize} 


\section{Thesis Overview}
{\color{blue}Finish and write this section afterwards the thesis is finished!} {\color{red} [santi: I marked it blue, just to distinguish text that is a place-holder from actual text :)]}

\section{Target Audience}
Advanced game developers who are interested in using PCGML game mechanics in their game are the core focus of this thesis. The theoretical part assumes a basic knowledge of game design and mechanics, PCG, \ac{AI}, and ML since it will not be explained everything in detail. In particular, specific topics of PCG and ML which contribute to the use of PCGML as a game mechanic will be discussed and handled in more detail.\\
The practical part concentrates primarily on the design and implementation of a game and game mechanics which makes it necessary for the reader to be familiar with these subjects. Particular algorithms used throughout the chapters will be covered in detail whereas basic algorithm knowledge is assumed. Furthermore, it does not require exceptional game development back-end skills since it addresses the use of the technique in game engines.

\chapter{Game Mechanics} \label{gameMechanicsChapter}
Starting this chapter with a quick insight into the \ac{MDA} framework which was introduced by \cite{mechanic::MDA}, helps to understand the foundation and the correlation of game mechanics in video games. In general, the MDA framework describes the division of gaming experience emergence into three dependent parts, starting with "Rules" followed by "System" and concluded with "Fun" \cite{mechanic::MDA}.  On this account, \cite{mechanic::MDA} described these fundamental parts of a game by the designs of mechanics, dynamics, and aesthetics. Therefore, mechanics contribute to a significant amount of gaming experience, and it needs adequately thought through mechanics because otherwise, a game will not be fun at all even if it has incredible graphics \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. Consequently, game mechanics are acting as one of the most critical roles in game design which is the reason to create awareness for this topic at the beginning of the thesis.
% one could mention the DDE framwork besides MDA \cite{mechanic::fromMdaToDde}

\section{Definition}
As already indicated, a game mechanic is a main concept with many underlying sub-concepts like dynamics, aesthetics, rules, systems, processes, procedures or data which all characterize the heart of a game besides story and technology \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. It also creates gameplay and the experience of playing a game. But besides, there is no concrete definition of what a game mechanic is. Nonetheless, there are some key concepts mentioned by different game designers which contribute to an interpretation of what a game mechanic can or shall be or do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Defines how a game is played, their objectives can be achieved or how to lose a game \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Thus, mechanics are precisely designed, detailed, specified and implemented to fulfill playability \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. 
	\item Often used to indicate the most influential and affecting aspect of a game which is also mostly referred as core mechanic \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. 
	\item Enables interaction and control of game objects and elements \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}.
	\item Is mostly hidden from the player, media-independent and easy to learn \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. For example, players are mostly aware of primary and often explained mechanics like character abilities whereby mechanics like an enemy damage model with its damage points are hidden concepts \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}.
	\item Can also be described as a meeting point for a designers question and their provided tools for answering that question by a player \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MikeStout}. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Types of Mechanics}
It is evident that one tries to divide possible mechanics into concrete types since of their various possibilities and shared base ideas. For this purpose, \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} summarized different types of game mechanics which are mainly used in games nowadays. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} first categorized them into the following five types which are listed below with some related mechanics:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Physics}: Motion and forces like gravity, shooting, fighting, jumping, moving, driving or any other kind of position change. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Internal Economy}: In general, all game elements which involve transaction like collecting, consuming, harvesting, buying, building, upgrading, risking or customizing of resources like currency, ammunition, portions, power-ups or other kinds of items. Also the use of energy, health, lives, power, points, popularity or experience and management actions for team, resources or inventory. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Progression Mechanisms}: Usually the elements or mechanisms which are controlling the players progress in the game world. For example, quests, missions, competitions, tournaments, races, challenges, levers, switches, locks, keys or unique items which allow a player to defeat an AI. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Tactical Maneuvering}: Is mainly used in strategy games but also in roleplay or simulation games and often deals with the placement of elements on a map like in chess. Mechanics are for instance internal tactics where a player gains offensive or defensive advantage, also team tactics and management of resources and buildings. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
	\item \textbf{Social Interaction}: Refer to rules that govern play-acting of a player or strategic actions of forming allies to defeat bosses or other allies like in roleplay games. Further mechanics would be e.g. reward of giving gifts, inviting new friends to join the game, competition between players or in particular mechanics in a co-op game where at least two players are forced to work together to achieve an objective. \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}
\end{itemize}
Besides, it is possible to subdivide all prior mentioned mechanics into discrete and continuous mechanics concerning their internal values \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. For example, the internal economy is mostly discrete since it is mostly represented by an integer value because, e.g., a player cannot pick up half of a portion — either she picks up the portion entirely or not \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. In contrast, continuous mechanics make use of high precision values for accuracy and is continuously calculated throughout the game like the movement of a character \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. \\
Furthermore, every type can also be used to categorize game genres based on their average usage in games. Table \ref{GameMechanicsToGenre} shows this distinction between mechanics and genres.

\end{table}\\
However, since the overview of \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign} is no universal taxonomy for game mechanics, there is another excellent approach to categorize them as described by \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Following somewhat similar types to \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}'s approach are used which also correlate to some parts described in the MDA framework:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Space}: Every game takes place in some game space or spaces \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Spaces can be continuous or discrete, consists of dimensions and can have bounded areas that may or may not be connected \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. The mechanics of Tic-Tac-Toe are an excellent example of this kind of mechanics which are taking place in a discrete space. 
	\item \textbf{Time}: Contains mechanics which are using time, clocks, races or controlled time \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. A favorite example of this kind of mechanics is the game SUPERHOT \cite{game::superhot} which tweaks the time to create a unique game experience.
	\item \textbf{Objects, Attributes, States, and Actions}: A comparison between mechanics and the structural elements of a sentence reveals similarities \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. Game objects represent the nouns, attributes and states are their adjectives and actions are the verbs of a game mechanic \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. This paradigm applies to most of the mechanics which enable interaction with game elements \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. 
	\item \textbf{Rules}: Combines all spaces, times, objects, actions and their consequences, constraints and the goals to form the behavior of the game \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. 
	\item \textbf{Skill}: Shifts the focus to the players and focus on their physical, mental and social skills \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}. That means it includes mechanics like dexterity, coordination, memory, observation, puzzle solving, reading or fooling an opponent or coordinating with teammates \cite{gameDesign::bookOfLenses}.

\section{Considerations with \acl{PCG} and \acl{ML}} \label{mechanicsConsiderationsPCGandML}
This chapter shall state some crucial considerations for the next chapters since \ac{PCG} and \ac{ML} game mechanics are not visible used in big game titles and therefore need particular attention on their implementation in a game. One of the good things is that there are dozens of possibilities for mechanics which should not create a big problem in coming up with new and novel ideas for new mechanics. With certainty, the focus of implementing such mechanics will lie on the introduction to the player and their ability for interactions because PCG and ML mechanics could confuse some players. Therefore, the implemented mechanics should be kept as transparent as possible if user interaction is needed instead of creating complex but novel and unusual mechanics. A good starting point is to design the mechanics as soon as the central gameplay concept is set and adhere to the design stages of concept, elaboration, and tuning during development \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}.\\
It is necessary to list some possible design flaws which need to be avoided since game mechanics shall amaze people instead of frustrate them while playing a game. In addition, a lot of detailed planning is made to come up with new extraordinary mechanics where plans about their proper introduction are missing \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. For this reason, it is relevant to address some common mistakes and their possible improvements:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Do not introduce all mechanics of a game as fast as possible because players need time to learn and get used to mechanics \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. For this reason, it is advisable to introduce just one mechanic at a time. 
	\item Do not introduce mechanics when the player has no time to explore them. They need time in their own pace to explore the mechanics otherwise they will not enjoy their new ability \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. 
	\item Use and create feedback loops for game mechanics otherwise players will not know what to do with them \cite{gameDesign::gameMechanicsAdvancedGameDesign}. For example, if someone uses a portion and there is no clear visualization for the use of it, then the player probably does not know what to use it. \\
	Introducing the concept of the basic grammar model described by \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel} shows that feedback is one of the most critical elements. This model can be applied to most of the games nowadays, and it loops the concepts of a mental model, intent, input, actual model and rules, state change and feedback \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel}. Where the mental model of a player assumes how a game works and what their intentions for the input and the actual input do, what then really happens with their input regarding applying core mechanics, concluded with feedback for their inputs \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel}. If there would be a lack of feedback, then the player could never update their mental model and cannot progress through a game. Feedback can appear in a quite simple binary or even complicated way \cite{mechanic::BasicGrammarModel}.
	\item Besides feedback loops, do not forget to provide the player with directions for parts of the mechanic which are or could not be visible to the player \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::MaxPears}. Further tutorials should be easily accessible if they are needed because there is nothing more frustrating to a player than being confused \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}.
	\item In particular, essential considerations for core mechanics are to provide clear rules on how to be successful, create a natural interaction but do not forget to challenge the player and provide the possibility for a natural progression of their skills \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}. Furthermore, they should adequately guide the player towards completing their in-game objectives with directions and feedback, allow players to progress from objective to objective in a natural way without the necessity of using the core mechanic and provide options besides the core mechanic \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}. 
	\item In general, the skill of a player will grow over throughout the game which means that the difficulty curve shall match the player's skill throughout a game \cite{mechanic::gamasutra::DanielDoan}. 
	\item As described by \cite{mechanic::generateAndAdaptingMechanics} where their goal was to generate and adapt game mechanics, it is necessary that mechanics fulfill the requirements of playability to create an acceptable experience. For example, a requirement could be that it is necessary that a player can reach the end of a level or win a fight without dying. Overall, it should ensure that a game is playable to a specific given goal with that mechanic \cite{mechanic::generateAndAdaptingMechanics}.

\chapter{\acl{PCG}}
\ac{PCG} is a broad topic in the game industry which has evolved throughout the years, and much research was done and is currently going on to enhance and further explore its possibilities. Accordingly, it is a necessity to introduce general parts of PCG to understand some concepts and therefore be able to understand its further use in PCGML.

\section{Introduction}
Game content creation is an expensive task where often many designers are involved over an extended period \cite{pcg::PCGinGameIndustry}. That is where the encouragement of \ac{PCG} comes into play! It aims towards automatic game content generation which is done by different algorithms on their own with or without direct user or designer input to decrease the cost of content creation \cite{pcg::PCGinGameIndustry} \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}.\\
However, it would be too easy to come up with a standard definition on what procedurally generated content in a game defines because too many people attempted it with way too many and different approaches \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}. With this in mind, procedurally generated content seems to be a concept with fuzzy and unclear boundaries which cannot be defined precisely \cite{pcg::whatIsPCG}. Nevertheless, for this thesis, content generated by PCG algorithms are seen as content or elements in a game which are affecting the gameplay, for instance, puzzles, quests, rules, dynamics, weapons, stories, terrain, maps and other similar kinds of game elements.

\subsection{Reasons to Use}
There are many reasons why PCG is a significant and rising topic in games. For this reason, \cite{pcg::inGameDesign} came up with two classifications representing the fundamental motivation behind using and researching PCG techniques.

\subsubsection{Utilization}
The first argument is utilization which is the principal argument why PCG is popular \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. It can be time-saving because it could produce more content than a human in an hour, for instance, a whole galaxy in No Man’s Sky \cite{game::noMansSky} \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. Moreover, PCG overcomes technical limitations concerning their use for devices with, e.g., limited space like mobile devices, it is expandable and has reusable code due to modularity and same field of applications \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. Lastly, it increases replayability because it can generate many similar but different instances of content \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}.

\subsubsection{Uniqueness}
The second argument why PCG is of particular importance is the uniqueness of their output \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}. It offers individual experiences with, i.e., different generated content every time and creates new gameplay and interaction modes through replayability or possible player interaction. It is unpredictable which can be a thrilling fact for players but also designers, it can create bizarre content no human might think of, and it can be an inspiration of infinity because of its possibility for creating infinite various content \cite{pcg::inGameDesign}.


\subsection{Taxonomy}\label{PcgTaxonomy}
The use cases for using procedurally generated content for different kind of problems with different methods and approaches are almost unlimited. This variety of PCG possibilities made it necessary to find distinctive features and create a taxonomy of PCG to highlight the differences and similarities between approaches \cite{pcg::book}. In fact, there are two different views for a taxonomy which were described by \cite{pcg::survey} and \cite{pcg::book}. The first and initial approach was created by \cite{pcg::survey} whereas the new one derived from \cite{pcg::survey}'s taxonomy was given by \cite{pcg::book}.\\
As an initial classification, \cite{pcg::survey} extracted the following four classes by analyzing all possibilities of PCG which they could think of:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Game Bit}: Basic elements of a game that do not affect the player's gameplay. For example, procedurally generated textures, sounds, trees, fire, stones, mountains or clouds. \cite{pcg::survey}
	\item \textbf{Game Space}: Represents game environments and usually consist of different game bits. One can think of, e.g., dungeons maps, whole planets with a procedurally generated terrain, lakes, rivers and many more. \cite{pcg::survey}
	\item \textbf{Game System}: Includes all game elements like ecosystems or other relations between game objects like rules or objectives. \cite{pcg::survey}
	\item \textbf{Game Scenario}: Like occurring events in games which could be, e.g., an event in a generated storyboard, the history of a character, a concept of levels or a puzzle. \cite{pcg::survey}
\end{itemize}
Whereas \cite{pcg::book} extended their view of possibilities for PCG and came up with the following 13 classes which are more focused on technical issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Online vs. Offline}: Is about runtime generated game elements or content as the player is playing the game versus predefined and or pre-generated content which is created before the start of a game \cite{pcg::book}. For instance, an interactive maze which is generated during runtime versus a procedural generated terrain which is used as the uniform environment of a game and does not affect the players playing experience in terms of a PCG process during the game.
	\item \textbf{Necessary vs Optional}: Distinguishes content which is necessary or required to reach an objective in a game and content which does not need to fulfill this or other requirements \cite{pcg::book}. For example, a puzzle could be necessary to finish the game whereas a generated texture is just an optional and cosmetic content.
	\item \textbf{Degree and Dimensions of Control}: Adds control over content generation via adjustable generator parameter or with a specific seed for a \ac{RNG}. In general, content where designers or users and players are in control over the generation space. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Generic vs Adaptive}: By means of generic content which does not take the behavior of the player into account whereas adaptive content could adapt on a players progress in the game and will be generated on top of their current progress and skills. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Stochastic vs Deterministic}: This paradigm differs content creation in a mathematical manner where deterministic algorithms will produce the same content over and over again provided that the same parameters are given whereas stochastic algorithms will create different content every time they are used. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Constructive vs. Generate-and-Test}: Addresses in one pass generated content versus generated and continuously improved content \cite{pcg::book}. Latter PCG method generates desired content as a result of continuous testing against requirements in a finite generate and test loop \cite{pcg::book}. Usually, there is some sort of AI involved in the evaluation of generate-and-test content \cite{pcg::book}. 
	\item \textbf{Automatic Generation vs Mixed Authorship}: By means of fully autonomous content generation provided by an algorithm versus generators where designers and players can change the behavior of the design process due to any kind of input and cooperate with the algorithm \cite{pcg::book}. For example, the creature creation in the game Spore \cite{game::spore} with automatically generated and user-created creatures.
\end{itemize}

\section{Development} \label{pcgDevelopment}
Developing a PCG algorithm can be tough and needs to be well-prepared. On this account, there are given some important design considerations about PCG and also a conceptual implementation of an algorithm in the next two sections.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
It is a good practice to stick to desirable and required properties when designing and developing algorithms and especially algorithms for generating content. One can quickly lose sight of crucial and influencing factors when developing a PCG algorithm with one of many various options which could lead to lousy player experience. For this reason, \cite{pcg::book} stated some of the most critical factors of an algorithm which should be satisfied:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Speed}: In general, this property depends on the online versus offline class which was described in chapter \ref{PcgTaxonomy}. Equally, whether a PCG algorithm produces content during gameplay or generated it before the core game starts, it should never exceed an acceptable amount of time which is needed to generate content because otherwise, it could affect the player’s experience. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Reliability}: Some generators create content from scratch without even knowing what they should produce whereas others are capable of generating and evaluating their content due to given requirements. For this reason, it is a very crucial property if someone wants to generate dungeons or puzzles because of their necessity of being a solvable problem which makes it either possible or not to progress throughout a game whereas a tree or flower which looks weird does not break a game. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Controllability}: Is also one of the most crucial properties of PCG since it is very useful to be in control in order to specify aspects of the generated content. Mainly, this refers to the classes of degree and dimensions of control, generic, adaptive deterministic as well as mixed authorship which was described in chapter \ref{PcgTaxonomy} and also overlaps with the desired reliability property. For example, a designer or a player-adaptive algorithm should have control over parameters to specify a desired outcome. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Expressivity and Diversity}: This property speaks mostly for itself because the human brain can quickly detect and recognize patterns in various environments. That makes it a necessity to develop algorithms which can generate content with a right amount of expressivity and diversity. \cite{pcg::book}
	\item \textbf{Creativity and Believability}: Following up the last property, it is also necessary that an algorithm produces believable content which cannot be distinguished to human designed content. It should not be evident for the players to be able to distinguish between algorithm-generated content and entirely designed content. \cite{pcg::book}
\end{itemize}
Notably, a central component which ties expressivity, diversity, and creativity together is their essential use of different implemented RNGs. There are possibilities like using a standard RNGs or the creating of randomness via knowledge presentation, distribution altering or look-up tables \cite{pcg::book}. For this reason, it is essential to give special considerations to the randomness implementation as well to fulfill the described properties. Some of the most important techniques used with random generations are, e.g., Perlin Noise, Simplex Noise or Fractals \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}.\\
Another helpful point is to visualize the PCG for either debugging or gameplay purposes \cite{pcg::book}. For example, visualization can help to understand the output and distribution of a PCG when used for debugging. Furthermore, if PCG requires interaction with the player, then it is useful to show some visual feedback or visualization so that players can understand the consequences of their actions on the system \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. \\
Lastly, it is recommended to keep PCG algorithms simple and focus them on specific content generation tasks so that a bunch of content generators could be combined afterward \cite{pcg::book}.  Also, players should not be overwhelmed by interactive PCG systems \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}. For this reason, avoidance is possible with simple sensors which are taking care of the players' experience and furthermore adapt the system, provided that it is an online system \cite{pcg::shortHistoryOfDynamicAndPCG}.  In general, all discussed points in chapter \ref{mechanicsConsiderationsPCGandML} should be taken in mind when implementing interactive PCG systems.

\subsection{Possibilities}
Using procedurally generated content in a game offers many possibilities as described in the last few sections. One of the most promising facts for using PCG in games is that players can experience a game in a new way each time it is played provided that it uses online systems \cite{pcg::gamasutra::tips}. For this purpose, \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity} extracted the creative facets of games where PCG can be used to create content in games. Beginning with visuals as the most prominent application where the most successful example is "SpeedTree" \cite{speedTree} which can create \ac{3D} models of trees and vegetation \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. However, also textures, every other kind of 3D or \ac{2D} models or even whole solar system as in the game "No Man's Sky" \cite{game::noMansSky} or visualizations are part of visuals \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. The next classification includes every kind of generated audio and narrative \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. Ludus also offers a vast field of possibilities where the term Ludus refers to activities under a system of rules which defines the outcome of a game \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}. Also, level architecture like generated maps or generated gameplay can be found as creative facets of games \cite{pcg::computationalGameCreativity}.\\
In general, the determining term in PCG is "content" which means that one can barely generate everything in a game \cite{pcg::book}! There is even a PCG algorithm called "Angelina" which can generate whole games \cite{pcg::angelina}.

\subsection{Conceptual Implementation}
PCG algorithms can vary from simple to very complex ones depending on the field of their application. Usually, they are algorithms which are fed with different parameters and then generate some content out of these parameters.\\
Algorithms, like used for world generation, can consist out of many details and therefore will not be addressed in this section. Instead, the development steps of an algorithm for generating complex rock structures called "Cascades" presented by \cite{nvidia::cascades} will be shown to give a quick insight in how a PCG algorithm can work.

\subsubsection{Cascades}
The simplification of \cite{nvidia::cascades}'s approach for a procedurally generated complex rock structure is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item 3D texture generation where density values represent either rock or air.
	\item Take the texture and make use of the Marching Cubes algorithm to generate the actual 3D model.
	\item Use tri-planar texturing to complete the model with textures.
\end{enumerate}
A possible output of this algorithm can look like in figure \ref{cascadesFigure} depending on their used \ac{RNG} and definition of density distribution in the 3D texture.

\end{figure}

\section{Game Mechanics}
Now it comes to the most crucial part of this chapter of PCG because of its leading part in PCGML as a game mechanic — the use of PCG as a game mechanic! This chapter provides an overview of games which are using PCG as a game mechanic and some examples of possible PCG core mechanics.

\subsection{Current Games} \label{pcgMechanicGames}
Many games are using procedurally generated content in their game nowadays, but not all of them are using PCG as a game mechanic. The following sections describe three games which are using PCG as a game mechanic.

\subsubsection{Galactic Arms Race}
Initially, a research project which is a perfect example of PCG-based core mechanics in a game \cite{game::galacticArmsRace}. Galactic Arms Race is a multiplayer space shooter game in which the player needs to complete tasks and missions to progress through the game \cite{game::galacticArmsRace}. To complete tasks and missions, players need to flight around in space and try to kill enemies with different weapons. A highlight of the game is the particle weapon system which is used to defeat enemies whereas weapons are entirely generated by a PCG algorithm which uses evolutionary AI algorithms to evolve and generate new weapons \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace}. The AI in Galactic Arms Race creates and evolves weapons based upon actions, strategies, and weapons which are used the most by a player \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace} \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace::evolvingContent}. Besides, a player can possess three weapons at a time whereby new evolved weapons are continuously spawned in space and dropped by enemies, and consequently, players need to decide which weapons they want to use and thus feed the AI with information about their preferences \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace::evolvingContent}. In this case, a player functions as the fitness function of the evolutionary algorithm used by the overall PCG system \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace::evolvingContent}.\\
In short, a combination of PCG algorithms and evolutionary AI algorithms produces the novel weapon system which represents the core mechanic of Galactic Arms Race.

\subsubsection{Inside a Star-Filled Sky}
Inside a Star-Filled Sky is an almost entirely procedural generated game \cite{game::insideAStarFilledSky}. The objective for a player is to progress through levels and try to reach one of the highest stages of progress to rule the leaderboard \cite{game::insideAStarFilledSky}. Players need to fight enemies, collect items, power-ups or weapons to defeat enemies and get over to the next level. Each level is generated and can represent the inside of an enemy, item or another entity in the game which gives the player an infinite choice of possibilities on how to play the game. Moreover, players can move in or out of the recursively nested levels, and every collected item or killed enemy change the random seed for generating the next level \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. Players can even move into their character to increase their power and more than 165000 simple weapon combinations are explorable due to PCG \cite{game::insideAStarFilledSky}.\\
Summarized, the core mechanic of Inside a Star-Filled Sky is heavily PCG-based and about exploring and progressing through generated levels with the help of generated weapons and items.

\subsubsection{Endless Web}
Is an entirely PCG-based game and thus uses PCG as its core mechanic \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. It is about fighting the nightmares in human dreams and rescue the trapped ones and thus releasing dreamers from their fears. The central objective of the game is to rescue six dreamers by exploring the world and make decisions on exploring new areas in the world which affects the parameters of the rescue progress and also the generation of new world parts \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}. For example, if a player kills an enemy then depending on the configuration, it strengthens or weakens an associated challenge and furthermore changes the world \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}.\\
So, Endless Web's core mechanic is about manipulating the generative space where players influence the changes of the world generation with their chosen decisions on how they are playing the game \cite{pcg::endlessWeb}.

\subsubsection{Other Games}
Games like Black \& White, Diablo, Dwarf Fortress, Elite, Eve Online, Roque, Spelunky or Minecraft are other good examples which made use of PCG and related mechanics as an essential part in their game.

\subsection{Possible Core Mechanics}
There are a few possibilities and use cases for PCG as mechanics in games. As seen, some core mechanics aim at weapon creation and progressing through generated space with the help of generated or altered "helper" mechanisms. Apart from that promising ideas are also other noteworthy ideas:
\begin{itemize}
	\item One exciting idea is about using PCG for multiplayer games as a multi-instance PCG system given by \cite{pcg::futureOfPcgInGames}. A game could use a central PCG system consisting of different and unique systems for each player, and every content generation would affect the PCG systems of other players \cite{pcg::futureOfPcgInGames}.  In that case, the core mechanic of the game would include influencing other players with each others PCG system to work towards a specific goal. For example, a use case would be a collaborative multiplayer game where each content generation causes a new content generated in the other’s player space, and they must find a way to communicate how to achieve a mutual objective \cite{pcg::futureOfPcgInGames}. 
	\item There is a lot of research done in the generation of quests as well. The research of \cite{pcg::questGenerator} introduced generated quests based on analysis of four existing \ac{MMORPG} and their quests. One could create a simulation game where players need to create random quests by doing interaction with the PCG system in order to provide an AI agent with missions which needs to be fulfilled to solve some other problems in the game and thus progress throughout the game.
	\item Another idea is to adapt existing and successful introduced game mechanics with a PCG-backend. For example, one could create a game like Tetris where the core mechanics of rotating a block generates new blocks. For example, every time the player rotates the block, the next block will be altered with evolutionary algorithms and changes their shapes to increase the difficulty. Moreover, the system could adapt its difficulty to the player's skills regarding the success or failure rate of using the new blocks to maintain an acceptable experience.
\end{itemize}

\clearpage
\chapter{\acl{ML}} \label{chapter::machineLearning}
\ac{ML} is such a vast topic so that a detailed explanation of every type, approach, method, and model used in ML would go beyond the scope of this thesis. Therefore, the next sections will describe essential subjects of ML which can be useful to understand its further use in PCGML. \\
However, let us ask a question first: What is the difference between ML and AI and what is ML about actually? The fact is, there is no difference between ML and AI. In particular, ML developed from fields of research in AI and is thus a subset of AI. It concentrates on using mechanisms to learn from given data where data represents experience for a given problem. For instance, a famous example of machine learning is an application where the machine can distinguish between apples and pears with the help of a given dataset of features for both apples and pears \cite{ai::book}. 

\section{Types of Learning Problems}
Machine learning consists out of three main types which all address a different kind of problem to solve and goal to achieve. One can classify types of supervised learning, unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning \cite{ml::book::developer}. Each of them functions as a solver to a specific task or problem where it fits best and creates the desired results.

\subsection{Supervised Learning}
This type of learning is a task-driven approach of ML \cite{ml::book::developer}. Its primary application is predicting or approximating data based on existing historical or empirical values where the answer to the problem is already known \cite{ai::book}. The previously described problem of classifying apples and pears is a problem is a supervised learning problem which is solved by predicting the specific fruit or also referred as a class \cite{ml::book::developer}. In this case, we would provide a sample set of real data with features for both fruits and classify each feature to a specific fruit. With this, the algorithm links the given features to a specific result and can predict those fruits based on a given test set \cite{ml::book::developer}. A training and test set could exist out of a bunch of pictures or other specific features described with numeric values in a table for each fruit. Hence, the reason why this is called supervised learning is that an ML algorithm is provided with data and therefore knows what to learn \cite{ai::book}.\\
Typical applications for supervised learning are, for example, image recognition and classification, spam detection, pattern detection, speech recognition, \ac{NLP}, sentiment analysis or forecasting \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.

\subsubsection{Regression}
A statistical process is the basis of this supervised learning technique where particular probability distributions of a given training data control the prediction output \cite{ml::book::developer}. In specific, a regression algorithm is processing independent and dependent variables of a given problem and build relationships between them which are furthermore used to predict the correct answers of a given unknown set \cite{ml::book::developer}. Independent variables are describing features and dependent variable the meaning or outcome of a regression problem. Usually, regression algorithms are applicable when the output values are constant prediction problems like for example, the predicted time of completion for a game level based on, e.g., the current player position \cite{ai::book}.\\
Some use cases where concepts of regression algorithms can be applied are, e.g., for imitation and prediction of a player's behavior or player preference learning \cite{ai::book}. Some popularly used algorithm for regression are the linear or polynomial regression, \ac{ANN} or \ac{SVM}. \cite{ai::book}

\subsubsection{Classification}
Addresses problems where classification transition of independent values into specific values is needed \cite{ai::book}. The famous problem of classifying and distinguish apples and pears from each other falls into this section.\\
Like regression algorithms, classification algorithms are applicable for imitation and prediction of a player's behavior, such as prediction of completion time \cite{ai::book}. However, in this case, the possible outputs are specific values or classes like slow, average or fast instead of continuous values \cite{ai::book}. Some popularly used algorithm for classification are, e.g., \ac{ANN}, decision tree, random forests, \ac{SVM}, K-nearest neighbor or ensemble learning \cite{ai::book}.

\subsection{Unsupervised Learning}
In contrast to supervised learning, the base of unsupervised learning is a data-driven approach where the algorithm has no information about the meaning or value of any sample and needs to infer it automatically \cite{ml::book::developer}. Hence, an unsupervised learning algorithm gets so-called unlabeled data without having a specific relationship to the target output and finds unknown structures and pattern in that set \cite{ai::book}. Thinking about the apples and pears example, then an algorithm would try to detect that there are two different types or classes in the dataset instead of predicting if its an apple or a pear.\\
Typical applications for unsupervised learning are object segmentation, similarity or pattern detection, automatic labeling, pre-training of supervised algorithms or pre-processing data such as data compression, noise smoothing or outlier detection \cite{ml::book::algorithms} \cite{ai::book}.

\subsubsection{Clustering}
For example, solves the previous described apples and pears problem by clustering apples and pears out of the given training set with features of both fruits. Based on the trained knowledge due to the training set, it can differentiate new and unknown samples into either apples, pears or an entirely new class \cite{ai::book}. In detail, clustering algorithms are looking for similarities between given features and values, and by doing this, they are inferring a relationship between them and thus separate specific classes \cite{ml::book::developer}.\\
Popularly used algorithms for clustering are, e.g., K-Means, neural networks or \ac{HMM}. \cite{ml::book::developer}

\subsection{\acl{RL}}
In short, \ac{RL} is a goal-oriented approach where an AI tries to reach a goal with the best strategy \cite{ml::book::developer}. RL uses so-called agents who are used to get feedback or specific states of an environment which is further used to learn and improve new decisions based on taken decisions \cite{ml::book::developer}. Inspired by the way humans and animals learn to take decisions, it aims at rewarding the algorithm for good behavior and thus leads it towards the best knowledge and output \cite{ai::book}. \\
In general, RL makes use of a bit of supervision in the form of feedback for an action executed by an agent \cite{ml::book::statistics}. Among experts, this feedback exists as the reward for actions in RL algorithms \cite{ml::book::statistics}.  The tricky part is that RL usually consists of following decisions and every chosen action — chosen out of a set of actions — by an agent is changing the environment which usually makes it difficult to train a model \cite{ml::book::statistics}. Hence, an agent executes different decisions in a loop and is looking for the highest total reward for its sequence of actions since it will always want to increase its total reward. \cite{ai::book} With this strategy, an RL algorithm is getting better and better over time in solving a specific problem until it found the best solution.\\
During the last years, RL algorithms have been used to learn an AI how to play classical games, find the best strategy to win a game, learn an AI how to walk and many other applications \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. Algorithms include neural networks, deep neural networks, Q-Learning or Markov decision process. \cite{ml::book::statistics}

{\color{blue}\todo[inline]{WRITE ABOUT IT!}}



\section{Development} \label{mlDevelopment}
Developing an easy to use AI needs to be a well-structured and planned process. Especially, when using ML as a focus of interaction, it is even more important to be well-prepared. For this reason, this reason addresses some design considerations about developing user-friendly AI systems in games, as well as standard pitfalls to keep in mind and also possibilities of how to use ML algorithms in two commonly used game engines.

\subsection{Design Considerations}
Someone cannot just develop a new novel AI system and expect to create a whole new experience — it needs to have a thoughtful plan how to achieve new experience \cite{ai::gameDesign}. Firstly, it is useful to think about the MDA framework, which was described in chapter \ref{gameMechanicsChapter}, because an AI-based game is often tightly integrated into its game mechanics and therefore it is necessary to make no mistakes in the first place to fulfill playability and emerging experience \cite{ai::gameDesign}. \\
Here are some critical considerations for AI-based games described by \cite{ai::gameDesign} which are also worth noting for implementing an ML-based AI system: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item First, develop a rough design of the game system and then model the AI system upon that game system or vice versa \cite{ai::gameDesign}. In particular, for AI-based games, the AI system should support the designed core experience of the game \cite{ai::gameDesign}.
	\item An AI should provide possible exploration and allow a player to experiment with it which means it should be robust enough and not lead to game crashes or misbehavior \cite{ai::gameDesign}. 
	\item Avoid a too mechanical and unnatural player experience with an unpredictable system \cite{ai::gameDesign}.
	\item The environment of an AI-based game should be observable for an AI system which means it should be able to access states of different game entities at any time \cite{ai::gameDesign}. Consequently, game states should be described in a way so that an AI system can easily access and read it \cite{ai::book}.
	\item A system should be as accessible and transparent as possible for a player so that a player will not be overwhelmed by the system and its possibilities \cite{ai::gameDesign}. Notably, an interactive ML system as an AI system in the game could be a confusing thing for a player if it, e.g., exposes too much information \cite{ai::gameDesign}. That is of particular importance when using \ac{RL} as the backbone AI agent algorithm.
	\item Provide ways for emergent gameplay with the help of the AI system with, e.g., possible strategies which can be applied to the system \cite{ai::gameDesign}. 
\end{itemize}
Lastly, the discussed issues and considerations in chapter \ref{mechanicsConsiderationsPCGandML} also apply for the implementation of an ML-based AI agent.

\subsection{Common Pitfalls}
Following pitfalls are commonly occurring problems when implementing and training machine learning models for a specific problem.

\subsubsection{Under- and Overfitting}
ML models are used to approximate unknown output based on given training data \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. When talking about fitting, then it is referred to fit a model to a given training set and its features which are used to train the model. This set can consist of many independent variables and different entries which can create some issues:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Underfitting}: Happens when the training set for the model consists of too less information or independent variables \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. In that case, the model is not able to capture the dynamics of the values \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.
	\item \textbf{Overfitting}: Is exactly the opposite of underfitting. When a model is over-fitted then it is fed with too much information and variables so that it is not able to generalize the dynamic relationship of variables during the training \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, a right amount of information for the training of a machine learning model should be provided to achieve an excellent fitted model. A method to check and prevent the model from being over or under-fitted is the technique of validation such as cross-validation which helps to detect those problems \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.

\subsubsection{Curse of Dimensionality}
This problem often occurs when the training set is smaller than the number of feature variables, or also called the dimensions of a set, which are used to train a model \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. In this case, if the number of features increases then the performance of the model gets dramatically reduced \cite{ml::book::algorithms}. Possible ways to prevent and solve this problem are, e.g., a decrease of dimensions or providing more training data \cite{ml::book::algorithms}.

\subsection{Game Engine Plugins} \label{chapter::mlPluginsGameEngines}
Indeed, all the different machine learning models or the one which applies to the game prototype of this thesis could be self-implemented. However, there are other people out there who have already implemented and improved their implementations which are a good starting point when implementing a PCGML game mechanic. As discussed at the beginning of the thesis, it is going to focus on an implementation in commonly used game engines which is the reason why to envisage the two most used free to use game engines nowadays.

\subsubsection{Unity}
Unity made an incredible effort in its research and use of machine learning in their engine in the last year \cite{unity::ml}. They recently released a beta version of an open-source ML agents plugin that enables games to train an AI with \ac{RL}, imitation learning, neuroevolution or other ML methods \cite{unity::mlGithub}. The base of the plugin is Google’s open-source ML framework TensorFlow \cite{api::tensorFlow} which is accessible via a simple-to-use Python \ac{API} \cite{unity::mlGithub}. They are also providing essential instructions and documentary for the usage of their plugin which is a promising, definite and significant advantage when implementing the PCGML game mechanic.

\subsubsection{Unreal Engine 4}
At the time of writing this section, there is no available officially announced ongoing plugin or feature development for ML in \ac{UE4}. However, there are others who were concerned about the missing feature of ML in UE4. For this reason, \cite{ue4::tensorFlowPlugin} created an open-source TensorFlow plugin for UE4 which implements a Python API accessible interface. Indeed, there are also some other plugins available via UE4's marketplace such as a Q-Learning plugin, but there do not look that promising as \cite{ue4::tensorFlowPlugin}'s TensorFlow plugin. Also, provided documentation and guidance on how to use the plugin leads it to a tolerable option besides to Unity’s ML agent plugin.

\section{Game Mechanics}
It is unclear which games used specific methods of ML for a game mechanic because there are not any research paper or published articles about, i.e., game companies who talked about using ML for their mechanics. Nevertheless, there is a research focus on AI-based games, including game mechanics which can be adapted with ML and is therefore used to come up with ideas for ML game mechanics. 

\subsection{Current Games}
Two games which use AI as a core mechanic were already described in chapter \ref{pcgMechanicGames} and are the games Endless Web and Galactic Arms Race. Both making use of a PCG and AI mixture mechanic where the AI generates new world segments based on game world states \cite{pcg::endlessWeb} or new weapons based on player preferences \cite{pcg::galacticArmsRace}. These games are going to be first reference points and inspiration when implementing a PCGML game mechanic. Other games which used ML techniques as a mechanic were, e.g., Black and White and Creatures \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. 

\subsubsection{Black and White}
The player is in control and owns a creature who can be trained to do things for the player. They used techniques such as decision trees and neural networks to train and learn it the prediction of a player's action \cite{ml::gamasutra::ml} \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. In particular, the belief-desire-intention approach was used to implement the creature's behavior \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. The creature's training happens due to a player’s reaction upon the creature's executed actions which therefore follows the rules of RL where the creature would like to achieve the best total reward for its behavior \cite{ml::gamasutra::ml}.

\subsubsection{Creatures}
That is a game where players need to hatch animals and try to teach them how to behave and survive in their world \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}. As well as Black and White, Creatures also used neural networks to teach and learn animals how to behave based on a player's input \cite{ml::mostInfluentalAiGames}.

\subsection{Possible Mechanics}
\cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern} introduced nine design patterns, summarized in Table \ref{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern} which illustrates ways to develop game mechanics based on AI techniques and furthermore to create AI-based games. Following sections describe some examples of possible mechanics or core mechanics with ML, based on \cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern}'s design patterns.

		\end{tabular}%
	}
	\caption{AI-based game mechanics design pattern \protect\cite{ai::aiBasedGameDesignPattern}}
	\label{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{AI as Role-Model}
For example, a game in which a player needs to follow an AI to solve quests or missions. Based on the players progress in each quest and imitation level, the AI adjusts its solution of solving the current or a new problem and provides the player with either a less competitive or harder solution and reward. Hence, player experience is adapting due to player behavior learning and predicting an appropriate difficulty level. For instance, a quest could be following or remembering the path of the AI to a treasure whereas built-in traps are crossing the way. Hypothetically, if the player cannot remember and succeed the path after, e.g., three times, then the AI shows a new and less challenging path to a less rewarding treasure.

\subsubsection{AI as Trainee}
Is one of the most promising design pattern since it revolves around teaching an AI different things whereby it fits perfectly for using ML methods. As introduced before, the games Black and White and Creatures are using precisely this kind of pattern for implementing their creature behavior. A game could use a mechanic like the same and introduce new mechanics on how to interact and use the AI agent by teaching it how to behave in specific situations. A simple idea would be a teaching game in which the player needs to educate fighters to defeat enemies. Alternatively, a tower defense game in which the player uses defense entities to teach an ML agent first target preferences.
	
\subsubsection{AI as Co-Creator}
An exciting base idea of a co-creator AI game would be a split-screen game in which the player plays on one side and the AI agent on the other side. The gameplay would be symmetrical, and everything a player does will be tried to imitate by the AI. In doing so, the player needs to do things to complete challenges whereas done actions affect the AI agents space and vice versa. For example, a challenge could be pushing a button which only exists in the space of the AI but opens, e.g., a door in the player's space. Therefore, the player would need to behave in a specific manner to lead the AI towards the button to progress through the game.

\chapter{\acl{PCGML}}
A purpose for research in AI-based PCG methods like PCGML was to invent algorithms which can create and generate content of the same type and style based on existing content with or without human involvement \cite{ai::book} \cite{pcgml::paper}. In general, \cite{pcgml::paper} defined PCGML as ''the generation of game content using machine learning models trained on existing content.'' \\
On this account, different research was and is going on to generate music, sound effects, images, textures, worlds or levels \cite{ai::book}. Research showed that ML-backed PCG methods are working well for music and images types but are facing some issues when it comes to world or level generation because of its necessity of playability to create an adequate experience for the player \cite{ai::book}. Thus, the generation of gameplay connected game content pointed out some challenges which further research is going to address and try to solve \cite{ai::book}. It is for this reason why PCGML approaches were not used in games yet. Another reason is that there is often not enough game content available to train a PCGML model on for a specific content generation problem \cite{ai::book}. \\
The next chapters introduce the difference to usual PCG, use cases of PCGML, some developmental features used in other research and explains how PCG and ML work together to generate new content. Overall, this chapter is not going into many details since all essential cornerstones of PCGML where discussed and introduced in the previous chapters.

\section{Difference to \acl{PCG}}
What usual PCG and PCGML have in common are their hand-made algorithms, parameters, and constraints made by developers \cite{pcgml::paper}. Typically, designers would use existing game data and content to get inspired by and create generators which can generate new material on top of that inspiration whereas PCGML itself can get inspired by existing data to develop new content and thus assist the designer \cite{pcgml::paper}. So, the basic idea is to train the PCGML model on various but same game content and produce new content \cite{pcgml::paper}. \\
In contrast, different PCG algorithms might use ML for evaluation, but their content generation process entirely relies on their specific domain space rather than a trained model space \cite{pcgml::paper}. For example, experience-driven PCG relies on models of player experience whereas PCGML models can use existing balanced domain-specific content to create new content \cite{pcgml::paper}.

\section{Use Cases}
The focus of PCGML is to generate new content based on training with existing content. For this reason, PCGML can be used mainly for adaption, reparation, evaluation, critique or analysis of new content but also for general PCG tasks like autonomous generation, co-creative, and mixed design or data compression \cite{pcgml::paper}.
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Autonomous Generation}: Is one of the primary applications for PCGML because it can generate game content without human input which is especially useful when online content generation is needed \cite{pcgml::paper}. Also, a designer could create, e.g., a set of levels and feed the model with these models to create new and novel but similar levels with the help of the PCGML system \cite{pcgml::paper}.
	\item \textbf{Co-creative and Mixed-initiative Design}: This use case focuses on the collaboration between designers and the PCGML algorithm \cite{pcgml::paper}. For instance, the algorithm could generate new content based on existing provided content as a draft for the designer who could polish and finish the drafted content afterward.
	\item \textbf{Data Compression}: PCGML offers significant potential for data compression with the help of ML. By extracting specific dimensions of game content can save data size and would allow more efficient storage \cite{pcgml::paper}.
	\item \textbf{Recognition}: This is where PCGML stand out from the conventional PCG algorithms. Its capability use of recognition makes it possible to analyze, evaluate, adapt, critique or repair either existing, new designed, player created or algorithm generated game content \cite{pcgml::paper}. 
	\item \textbf{Repair}: In particular, reparation of a designed or generated content can be a useful tool. For example, during generation or learning time, the algorithm could check for, e.g., playability of a level and repair it immediately or suggest a fix \cite{pcgml::paper}.
\end{itemize}

\section{Development Considerations} \label{PCGML::devConsiderations}
There are some unique development considerations to take when someone wants to make use of PCG via ML for game elements. In general, every design consideration, possible issue, pitfall and best practices described and discussed in chapters \ref{pcgDevelopment} and \ref{mlDevelopment} will apply when implementing PCGML algorithms. Furthermore, an initial examination of the data representation for the data used as the training set during the ML model’s training is necessary. On this account, the research of \cite{pcgml::paper} showed that every specific dataset has different but also shared possible training methods for the ML model to obtain excellent and practical generation results. The primarily used training models for their research purposes of using PCGML for, e.g., level generation were:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \ac{ANN}, \ac{CNN} or \ac{LSTM} networks
	\item Markov models such as N-grams or multi-dimensional Markov chains
	\item Bayes models
	\item Autoencoders
	\item Clustering
	\item Matrix factorization
\end{itemize} 

\subsection{TODO: Data Representation - IMPORTANT?!}
{\color{blue}One of the essential parts in implementing a PCGML system is the data representation of the data used as the training set in the ML model's training method. One can easily see a clear difference between the prediction of game elements and standard prediction problems such as the prediction of, e.g., an employee's monthly salary. The latter problem’s training set consists mostly of a simple data structure with some dependent values and a value which it needs to predict whereas this is not possible for a game element. In their survey focused on using PCGML systems mainly for a level generation, \cite{pcgml::paper} approached this problem with different techniques and tried different training models with different data representations. In general, they used the following three different data representations:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Sequences}: Represents a format for content which shows a natural order in its structure \cite{pcgml::paper}. For example, the Super Mario Bros. levels consist of this native format because the player can only traverse from left-to-right and it can be represented in a sequence \cite{pcgml::paper}. 
	\item \textbf{Grids}: This type of representation applies to game content which can be thought of as a two-dimensional grid \cite{pcgml::paper}. For example, a top-down view of a labyrinth is representable as a grid.
	\item \textbf{Graphs}: Are a general data representation of game content with the drawback of lack of distinct structural properties \cite{pcgml::paper}. 
\end{enumerate}
As mentioned before, every game element determines its data representation for which reason there is no general rule for the data representation. Nevertheless, the used data representations used in \cite{pcgml::paper} offer a good starting point when developing the data representation for the game mechanic.}

\section{Development Example}
There is no right or wrong proceeding in the generation process for PCGML. PCGML is a very new paradigm in the content generation community, and its research results drive the right or wrong approaches. With this in mind, the PCGML generation process can take shape in any form, and someone should do what fits best for the problem.\\
This section explains a development example of a generation process for continuous variables in a sequence data structure. However, chapter \ref{chapter::gamePrototype} provides the detailed development walk-through of a PCGML system. For this example, a data’s structure example for a PCGML system provides the figure \ref{fig::PCGML::devExample::sequenceBase}. As it is a sequence of data, there is a connection between all variables. In the figure, the node "S" represents a start value, and all other nodes represent data row values. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{PICs/PCGML_development_example_sequence_base}
	\caption{Basic sequence data representation for a PCGML system. }\label{fig::PCGML::devExample::sequenceBase}
\end{figure}
As shown in figure \ref{fig::PCGML::devExample::sequenceWithModels} with a dashed rectangle, each value pair has its trained ML model to predict the next values. 
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\linewidth]{PICs/PCGML_development_example_sequence_with_models}
	\caption{Basic sequence data representation for a PCGML system with shown ML models.}\label{fig::PCGML::devExample::sequenceWithModels}
\end{figure}
It is worth noting that values do not need just one predecessor, they can also have more than one predecessor which would change the dashed rectangles, ML models and their associated variables shown in figure \ref{fig::PCGML::devExample::sequenceWithModels}.

\subsection{Data}
First of all, it is necessary to come up with efficient and sufficient data for the system’s training. Depending on the variables, it does need more or less data for the model. For example, a data structure with around ten variables would probably need at least 100 data rows to train the ML model properly. Table \ref{table::PCGML::devExample::data} shows a simple example data table which could be usable for the systems training. The table’s data can contain any discrete or continuous values which could originate from any decoded non-numerical data.
\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|}
		\hline
		\textbf{S} & \textbf{V\textsubscript{1}} & \textbf{V\textsubscript{2}} & \textbf{...} & \textbf{V\textsubscript{n}} \\ \hline\hline
		6           & 2.1         & A           & ...          & 100         \\ \hline
		3           & 5           & B           & ...          & 64          \\ \hline
		...         & ...         & ...         & ...          & ...         \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{PCGML example data table.}
	\label{table::PCGML::devExample::data}
\end{table}\\
Furthermore, a standard procedure in ML is the technique of data pre-processing so that data values are consistent with each other. For example, if the data set provides categorical data like the values for \textbf{V\textsubscript{2}}, as shown in table \ref{table::PCGML::devExample::data}, then this data needs to be encoded, so it does not differ from the other data values. This procedure is a standard procedure in the data pre-processing for training an ML model and can be done with so-called "One Hot Encoding." Table \ref{table::PCGML::devExample::oneHotEncoder} shows an example of what a One Hot Encoder does with categorical data as provided by \textbf{V\textsubscript{2}}. 
\begin{table}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
		\cline{1-1} \cline{3-5}
		\textbf{V\textsubscript{2}} &  & \textbf{V\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{1}} & \textbf{V\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{2}} & \textbf{V\textsubscript{2}\textsuperscript{3}} \\ \hhline{=~===}
		A           & $\longrightarrow$         & 1           & 0           & 0           \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-5} 
		B           & $\longrightarrow$         & 0           & 1           & 0           \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-5} 
		C           & $\longrightarrow$         & 0           & 0           & 1           \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-5} 
	\end{tabular}
	\caption{One Hot Encoder example.}
	\label{table::PCGML::devExample::oneHotEncoder}
\end{table}
The new values generated by the One Hot Encoder replace the old categorizes values and the data set is ready to go.

\subsection{Training}
After provision and pre-processing of the dataset follows training. Training can happen with different training models as described in chapter \ref{PCGML::devConsiderations}. For example, the use of an ANN or Gaussian Mixture Model could be a suitable training model for a given example dataset. In the scenario of the given sequence data, the \ac{NN} would be trained for each pair of values to output the next value in the sequence. Figure \ref{fig::PCGML::devExample::NNbasic} shows an example for an \ac{NN} where the start value and the first variable are used to predict the second variable.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{PICs/PCGML_development_example_NN_basic}
	\caption{Basic neural network to output a variable based on given input variables.}\label{fig::PCGML::devExample::NNbasic}
\end{figure}
In specific, the training of several NN’s for every following variable of the data sequence is necessary. Another possibility to use NN would be to make use of the so-called "Softmax" function which outputs the categorical distribution or probability distribution of a variable. With this probability, it can generate and train the following variables. Figure \ref{fig::PCGML::devExample::NNwithSoftmax} shows this kind of NN with an example probability distribution in the output layer.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.45\linewidth]{PICs/PCGML_development_example_NN_categorical_distributions}
	\caption{Neural network with an example probability distribution in the output layer.}\label{fig::PCGML::devExample::NNwithSoftmax}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Generation}
The next step in developing a PCGML system after the correct training of the model is the generation process. This process can differ depending on the used training model, given data and data representation. For example, the system could generate the first variable and get the rest of the variables by the model. Alternatively, it could generate any variable in the sequence and retrieve the other from that variable. Alternatively, it could make use of the probability distribution output by the Softmax function which leads the variables and generates a new piece of game element. As mentioned at the beginning of this chapter, there are no standards in the PCGML generation process, and someone can make use of every possibility which is provided by the system.

\chapter{Possible Game Mechanics}
The initial ideas on how to use PCGML as a game mechanic were created by \cite{pcgml::paper}. They came up with the following seven different ideas based on the AI-based game design pattern described in chapter \ref{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern}:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Role-Model}: "A \ac{PCGML} system replicates content which is generated by players of various levels of skill or generates content suitable for players of certain skill levels. New players are trained by replicating the content or by playing the generated content in the form of generative tutorial." \cite{pcgml::paper}
	\item \textbf{Trainee}: "The player trains a \ac{PCGML} system to generate a piece of necessary content (e.g., part of a puzzle or level geometry)." \cite{pcgml::paper}
	\item \textbf{Editable}: "Rather than training the AI to generate the missing puzzle piece via examples, the player changes the internal model’s values until acceptable content is generated." \cite{pcgml::paper}
	\item \textbf{Guided}: "The player corrects the \ac{PCG} system’s output to fulfill increasingly difficult requirements. The \ac{AI}, in turn, learns from the player’s corrections, following the player’s guidance." \cite{pcgml::paper}
	\item \textbf{Co-Creator}: "The player and a \ac{PCGML} system take turns in creating content, moving towards some external requirements. The \ac{PCGML} system learns from the player’s examples." \cite{pcgml::paper} 
	\item \textbf{Adversary}: "The player produces content that the \ac{PCGML} system must replicate by generation to survive or vice versa in a “call and response” battle." \cite{pcgml::paper}
	\item \textbf{Spectacle}: "The \ac{PCGML} system is trained to replicate patterns that are sensorically impressive or cognitively interesting." \cite{pcgml::paper}
\end{itemize}
These ideas were used to come up with more ideas on how to use PCGML as a game mechanic in modern video games.

\section{Concepts}
\subsection{Rules and Behavior} \label{idea::rulesAndBehavior}
A possible idea is a PCGML system which generates rules for a strategy game. A generic and modular strategy game offers the perfect foundation for generating its internal rules and behavior based on its internal elements. In particular, a strategy game mostly exists out of different sequences of actions emerging from new elements in the game which furthermore lead the game in a specific direction. All of those available actions have a different effect in the game whereas the effects can be changed with other appropriate effects causing different changes during the game. More particular, the design of a strategy game can introduce more game elements than used in the game itself. This kind of game element preselection often arises in cardboard games where players need to choose the available cards in advance which affects the flow of the game. For example, if a game provides the players with 25 different elements and just ten elements are used in the game, then it provides, regarding the mathematical theorem of combinatorics, 3268760 possible ways to play a game. This formula only applies if the introduction of each element happens after a specific time with no reuse of elements. Moreover, specific conditions for, e.g., the specific timeslot of an element's revelation can also be a part of the generation process which emerges a more dynamic game.\\
In this case, working configurations of the game provide the training set of the PCGML system with which it learns the different dependencies between elements and effects to each other. 

%$ \dfrac{N!}{n!(N-n)!} = \dfrac{25!}{10!15!} = 3.268.760 $

\subsection{Changing Weapons} \label{idea::changingWeapons}
Game mechanics often share a connection with some interactable objects. In the case of a \ac{FPS} game, different weapons like guns, rifles or shotguns represent these interactable objects. Moreover, different weapons often result in other mechanics such as particular tactics. With this in mind, another idea of using PCGML as a game mechanic is its use as any weapon generator. In specific, an FPS game with generated weapons where providing different weapons at the training time results in different ways to play the game. A virtually created weapon can have different properties, such as weight, blowback power, firing rate, ammunition and others which form the base to generate new weapons procedurally. Furthermore, as weapons need ammunition, the generation of new bullets and projectiles can also be part of the PCGML system. \\
For example, a game could be an FPS game with generated weapons from a pre-trained PCGML system whereby the model will be fed with the new generated weapons during runtime and furthermore specializes in a specific direction. After a bunch of time, the system only generates a specific weapon, and that is where the game or session would end.

\subsection{Changing Powers} \label{idea::changingPowers}
Often, the central mechanic provided in most \ac{RPG} is fighting with a sword, any weapon or applying magic spells as an attack on the enemy. Moreover, the weapons often possess a magic power as advantage or disadvantage. These powers and the magic spells themselves can be part of a generation process powered by a PCGML system. The system could generate new weapons or spells affecting the duration, spell category, continuing effect on the enemy or player, energy cost and other similar and often used properties. Providing useful weapons with advantages or disadvantages or some magic attacks as an example would serve as the training of the system.

\subsection{Solver Weapon} \label{idea::solverWeapon}
The solver weapon is an idea based on the co-creator pattern described in chapter \ref{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern}. It is about a game mechanic of using a generation weapon to progress through the game. The weapon's purpose is to help the player in special conditions such as solving puzzles with a missing piece in it. The highlight of the game mechanic is the required drawing interaction to generate a missing piece. A player needs to draw the missing piece on a given "drawing panel" connected with the weapon which tries to replicate the figured piece. Drawings could consist of big solid circles indicating corners and lines representing edges. The detection of the drawing involves object detection via ML which forwards detected chunks to the PCGML system. For example, introductive gameplay could be to find or generate the missing key for a door whereas the player is aware of the lock's shape.\\
This idea could work as follows: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Different input with different drawings of puzzle elements or geometric shapes depending on the style train the ML model. The system is then able to detect essential points on the drawing and suggests what the drawing would be.
	\item The PCGML system detects the drawings with any object detection algorithm. As the system has obtained the chunks of the detection algorithm, it uses each chunk data to generate a fragment of geometry and finally combines all of them into a combined shape.
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore, an extension of this idea is able with the trainee and guided pattern where the player would provide the system with feedback if the PCGML system outputs the wrong object. In this case, it would learn the specific drawing conventions of a player and adjust itself to the player.

\subsection{Defeat of the Enemy} \label{idea::defeatTheEnemy}
The PCGML system tries to defeat the player, and one or more players try to defeat the enemy. The adversary design pattern described in chapter \ref{AI-basedMechanicsDesignPattern} where the role of the AI is to defeat the player forms the base of this idea. In this case, the system is trained on simple player behavior such as movement paths or attack preferences in a specific environment and uses this knowledge to overcome the player. Moreover, it would also be able to find new behavior pattern during the fight. In short, the output of the system is new tactics, behaviors or attack sequences for the AI on how to defeat a player. Furthermore, the PCGML system could categorize used behavior regarding their success or failure and learn from these outcomes to increase its accuracy. \\
An example scenario would be that an AI has the intention of applying a critical hit to the player. In doing so, the PCGML system generates, e.g., a possible path to fulfill the desire of hitting the player based on, e.g., both the players and AI positions and the pre-trained knowledge.

\subsection{Caught in a Thunderstorm} \label{idea::caughtInAThunderstorm}
A game which revolves around a player which is in control of a thundercloud and has the objective to destroy cities or enemies with the power of lightning. In this scenario, a PCGML system would generate a pattern for the diffusion of lightning and impact points based on different weather conditions, cloud height, enemy or building position, physical materials and similar properties. This idea offers its potential as a thunderstorm simulation game supported by empirical or real weather data as the training set for the PCGML system.

\subsection{Train to Progress} \label{idea::trainToProgress}
A player is forced to play with an empty and untrained PCGML system. The system can generate an essential part of the gameplay but needs to be trained first to activate its full potential of generating necessary or missing elements. In this case, a player’s primary objective is to train the PCGML system to progress towards a given goal. For instance, a puzzle game where the central puzzle is the system’s training to generate, e.g., some missing piece. A level could contain hidden objects which need to be found first to train the system correctly. \\
For example, if the goal would be to unlock a locked door with a generated key, then the player needs to find sample keys first to train the system with those which are similar to the lock's key. If there isn’t any success in generating the right key, then the player can reset the internal model of the system and try it again with another pair of sample keys. This principle also offers its application with other kinds of objects and is mainly based on the trainee design pattern.

\subsection{Building with Assistance} \label{idea::buildingWithAssistance}
Revolves around a PCGML system, trained to generate incomplete game elements for a specific goal. For example, a building game where the PCGML system never outputs the correct element which is currently needed. On the other hand, the player has the abilities to improve and overhaul the generated elements. To guide its internal model to a desired generation output direction, all changes made by the player are feed into the system. Thus, the guide design pattern with the focus on guidance is the base of this idea. The training of the PCGML system would consist of examples of incomplete but usable and modification able game elements.

\subsection{The exploring Co-Worker} \label{idea::exploringCoWorker}
Another idea based on the co-creator pattern could be, e.g., a strategy game where the player’s focus is to mine, build and create strategic plans to overcome its opponent. Moreover, to evolve in the game, the player possesses a PCGML system which is used to explore and conquer new sections of a map. This system would work entirely on its own and functions as a helper and teammate for the player. The exploration process of a new section consists mainly of creating new terrain by the system. In this case, the system is trained to generate new chunks or section of unexplored terrain mainly based on the player’s progress, mined resources, and similar elements.

\subsection{Observe and Learn} \label{idea::observeAndLearn}
A PCGML system which is trained to generate and modify terrains with a particular path within the terrain to reach a specific goal. The highlight is that the system does not always generate possible ways which demand the player to change properties of the system which changes a terrain, the level, map or world. In doing so, the player is forced to observe the interactive and smooth changes of the system to reach the current goal. The visualization and editable design pattern form the base for this idea.

\subsection{Express Yourself} \label{idea::expressYourself}
An application as a game mechanic in a point and click game could be a PCGML system, trained to generate new storylines, events, choices and outcomes of chosen choices. The system is trained on designed stories and learns the dependencies to create new and novel storylines which individual possible choices and outcomes. Like in the idea described in \ref{idea::rulesAndBehavior}, the designer can provide more game elements than used in the game which provides the system which a variety of possibilities on how to compose the game. The spectacle pattern is the base of this idea of a PCGML generated story.

\subsection{Big Boss Helper} \label{idea::bigBossHelper}
Based on the villain pattern in which the AI mobs a player rather than tries to defeat them, is this idea. This kind of design pattern fits almost perfectly in, e.g., an RPG game big boss fight with more than one \ac{NPC} to defeat. For example, there are two NPC’s to defeat to win the fight and obtain unique items - one applies mainly damage, and the other one protects the other one. This helper NPC is represented by the PCGML system which is trained on player behavior such as attack preferences or movement behavior in a specific level or environment to generate or alter the terrain or level to keep the player off the main enemy in the fight.

\subsection{Figure it Out} \label{idea::figureItOut}
A possible application in a multiplayer game could be a mechanic in which each player possesses a PCGML system for generation purposes. However, the challenge in the game is that each generation of the system changes the other’s systems output, and they need to work together towards a specific goal. For instance, a puzzle game where players need to figure out the connection between their system. The PCGML system would be trained with a specific game corpus and enables interaction based on the editable pattern. The player changes parameters and also changes the other while they need to generate an object combined with each of the system's output. Parameter adjustment can either be done directly or indirectly with any moving stones around in a room and find the right position. Furthermore, this idea is also applicable in a single player puzzle game without the need of another player.

\subsection{Novel Vehicles} \label{idea::novelCars}
Another possible field of application for a PCGML system can be the generation of cars or vehicles as they also consist of many properties and parameters. The process of finetuning of these properties is usually a long process which is a perfect field of application for an ML trained PCG system.

\section{Development Evaluation of Concepts}
The main issue in the implementation of the PCGML system will be the training data for the ML model rather than the PCG output itself. Proper training for the ML model requires the right amount of training data to function as intended. The size of the right dataset can differ from application to application based on the given values as dependencies for an output. Following chapters evaluate each game mechanic based on their pros and cons for possible implementation. In particular, each idea has the advantage of PCGML that it can generate similar elements as used during training time, the possibility of changing the training set and thus the output and also no need of finetuning to generate a broad range of elements in contrast to standard PCG algorithms. For this reason, as it is the implication of using PCGML, these described advantages are not mentioned in the evaluation. Also, the provision of playability is a necessary criterion which contributes equally to each game mechanic.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It needs a good design of balanced and tweaked spells.

	\item The creation of puzzles does not need to consider the PCGML system because the puzzle forms the base of the system's implementation.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It takes time to train the model by the player correctly, and it can be frustrating if the model does not learn properly.

\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item PCGML implementation focuses only on the exploring task.
	\item Terrain generation can be based on the game corpus and does not apply to specific rules. Thus, training of the ML model with sample terrains should be easy.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item PCG generation and especially interactive modification of terrain can be complicated.

\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item PCG generation and especially interactive modification of terrain can be complicated.
	\item The necessity of "incorrect operation" for challenging terrain generation needs to be secured.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\nameref{idea::expressYourself}}

\subsection{\nameref{idea::bigBossHelper}}
The same pro and cons described for the mechanic "\nameref{idea::defeatTheEnemy}" apply to this concept since their PCGML systems are operating in the same manner.

	\item Training of the ML models should be easy since the system is modeled based on a puzzle. 
	\item Each PCGML system focuses on its piece of the puzzle element.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item It needs training for each ML model and puzzle.
	\item Each puzzle element needs own design and own PCGML system.
	\item The connection between PCGML systems will be complicated; therefore it needs a good design of the system’s connection.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{\nameref{idea::novelCars}}
\textbf{Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The generated vehicles can decide the kind of game; therefore it does not matter what the system's output is as long it secures playability.
	\item Vehicles are not limited to cars; therefore it can be any driveable vehicles.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The training set needs the designs of many vehicles so that the system can learn the complex dependencies of a vehicle.
	\item The design of vehicles often involves a long process of balancing.
\end{itemize}

\section{Summary}
The ideas how someone can make use of PCGML as a game mechanic show that there are many possibilities which differ in the complexity of implementation. Appendix \ref{gameMechanicIdeaSummary} provides a summary of each PCGML game mechanic training data and output.\\
Many of the ideas are about generating items used as a game mechanic, but PCGML also offers the possibility to generate any item such as quests, missions or challenges. Furthermore, the implementation of any progression mechanics is also applicable via PCGML. It just needs the right idea and a training set with an appropriate data representation to properly train the ML system.

\subsection{Game Mechanic for the Prototype}
As already mentioned, all the introduced ideas differ in their development complexity. Most of the ideas require a sophisticated game design where the PCGML game mechanic can work and create an adequate experience for the players. For instance, ideas like "\nameref{idea::trainToProgress}" or "\nameref{idea::figureItOut}" offer an interesting approach for creating unique player experience but require a very sophisticated game design and much balancing for polishing. For this reason, the easiest and most applicable ideas for showing the potential of PCGML as a game mechanic in this thesis offer "\nameref{idea::changingWeapons}" and "\nameref{idea::changingPowers}." Availability of open source FPS projects and real weapon data leads the decision for the prototype game mechanic to the idea of "\nameref{idea::changingWeapons}." Therefore, the rest of this thesis deals with the implementation of a PCGML game mechanic prototype which revolves around PCGML generated weapons.

\clearpage
\chapter{Game Prototype Preparations} \label{chapter::gamePrototype}
Dedication of this chapter is the development of a game prototype which uses the PCGML game mechanic chosen in the last chapter. Every section in this chapter is in direct relation with this PCGML game mechanic which does not mean that the process is not applicable for other PCGML game mechanics. Most of the described process is transferable and follows a fundamental principle suitable for every other kind of PCGML game mechanic. \\
The next sections contain every conceivable necessary topic of implementing the PCGML game mechanic "\nameref{idea::changingWeapons}" in a game prototype. From an initial game idea to the most useful game engine to the training model and the working prototype. Note that the game idea functions as an idea of which a prototype with a PCGML game mechanic emerges rather than being a thoroughly sophisticated game. This chapter functions as a proof-of-concept and shows how a PCGML game mechanic can be implemented and used in a game.

\section{Test Scenario}
A one player \ac{PvE} arena-like 3D game scenario in which the player is in control of a PCGML system which produces weapons such as pistols, machine guns and other kinds of guns to interact. Specific datasets of weapons can bias the system which leads the kind of game and its flow. The game forces the player consistently to make use of the weapons to win the game. 

\subsection{Environment and Objective}
The environment is a mountain-forest-like environment. The player spawns anywhere on the map and needs to find the arena and the last AI opponent which then starts the battle of the changing guns which also represents the last fight of the scenario. Figure \ref{prototype::exampleMap} shows an example of the map with different player spawn locations and the arena in the middle. The player's primary objective is to defeat the end game boss AI in a battle at the end of the scenario. The player either wins or loses the battle but can retry after a loss.
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{PICs/Prototype/map_example}
	\caption{Example of the prototype scenario map.}\label{prototype::exampleMap}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Training Session}
However, first of all, the player needs to fight against NPC enemies on the way to the arena to specialize and get used to the weapons. Even though this is a training session, the player has a specific amount of lives and need to take care of them. If the player loses all of the lives during this session, then the game is lost, and it ends.

\subsubsection{Battle of the Changing Guns}
Initialization of the battle happens as soon as the player is in a specific range to the AI in the arena. As soon as the player initiated the battle, the training session ends and recovers the player's lives for an epic final battle. The player can now move everywhere on the map and needs to defeat the AI with his weapons to win the game. Ammunition, health, and armor packages are randomly, but in player's range, spawned during the battle, so that the player needs to walk around in the map to give the battle more energy.

\subsection{TODO: Weapon and Ammunition}
The Player can hold two generated weapons at a time but can use one at a time. Generated weapons come with a specific ammunition pack at generation time with the possibility to refill ammunition during the game. The player can either use a weapon as long as ammunition is available or dismantle it at any time to generate a new weapon.\\
Every generated weapon is feed into the existing PCGML model to specialize the system’s model in a specific direction.
{\color{blue} feedback to generated weapons so that the player know a little bit about them. e.g., heavy/light weapon, damage, ammo, etc.. show the advantage and disadvantage to provide feedback\\
The next weapon will be generated with some noise added to the old weapon. noise strength is based on statistics how weapon was used (time, kills, etc)}

\subsection{Player and Enemies}
The player is a third-person character with a specific amount of health, armor, and lives with no customization options. Synchronization of the values of these mentioned properties with the properties of the generated weapons is necessary.\\
A simple AI controls all enemies to act as a training enemy for the battle. Enemies come in three different types of ascending power and health. They spawn in fixed locations throughout the training path. The enemies desire is to eliminate the player in a straightforward way rather than in a complex and sophisticated way. Killed enemies will drop ammunition, health, and armor which players can gather to refill their ammunition, health, and armor.\\
The design of the boss AI enemy defines specific base health, armor and damage. The base values increase with the time of the training session and regenerate during the battle.

%\section{TODO: Development Considerations}

\section{Which Game Engine?}
The decision of the most applicable game engine is not only about how quickly the implementation for an FPS game could be done but also about their support for ML. The decision envisages the two most used free to use game engine nowadays but could also envisage others. Another reason to further examine this two particular engines is the writer's expertise for them.\\
As described in chapter \ref{chapter::mlPluginsGameEngines}, both Unity and UE4 have available ML plugins for their engine. The development of Unity's ML plugin is boosted by Unity's developer them self whereas UE4's ML plugin is a community member created open source plugin. Nevertheless, both are using the same concepts of including ML functionality into the engine. In specific, they are using a Python interface to make use of the open source machine learning framework TensorFlow. With this in mind, the next chapters concentrate on the workflow in each engine to find the most suitable game engine for implementing the PCGML game mechanic.

\subsection{Unity}
Unity's plugin is actively in development, is mainly focused on the development of ML-agents or so-called \ac{NPC}s and supports multiple environments and \ac{OS} \cite{unity::mlGithub}. They are focusing the development of learning methods like RL, imitation learning and curriculum learning but also enable the application of other methods \cite{unity::mlGithub}. Moreover, their GitHub page offers an extensive introduction to ML and their plugin, some example projects on how to use the ML plugin and is a perfect starting point to dive in. \\
With this said, in the beginning, and before any functionality of the plugin is usable, it needs an installation of a Python and TensorFlow environment on the PC. This installation is a different procedure and can sometimes be a tricky thing dependent on the \ac{OS} and preferences for TensorFlow.\\
Once the installation process of all prerequisites is complete, nothing stands between the developer and a working ML environment. The first thing to do is a setup of a training environment to train a new model and to make use of it. This learning environment is a usual Unity Scene and consists of an academy, brain and the ML-agents itself, created and programmable in C\#:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Academy}: Is mainly used to communicate with the brain, agents and Python API \cite{unity::mlGithub}. Involved in environment observations and the decision-making process \cite{unity::mlGithub}. 
	\item \textbf{Brain}: Encapsulates the logic for decision-making process for the agent \cite{unity::mlGithub}. For example, for an RL based brain, holds the policy for the agent and the given rewards for received observations \cite{unity::mlGithub}.
	\item \textbf{Agent}: Is just a Unity GameObject which generates observations and processes provided actions by the brain \cite{unity::mlGithub}.
\end{itemize}  
As soon as the training environment is set up, the real training can begin with the first build of just the training environment. In particular, the external Python environment does the whole training of the model. This environment contains the logic of the ML algorithm based on the TensorFlow framework. The Python environment itself can start the training environment build and communicates with Unity’s academy with the help of sent \ac{JSON} data over an open socket connection. After the training's completion, it is possible to save the trained model to use it in the game. A trained model is saveable in a ".byte" data format which can then be used instead of the previously created brain.

\subsection{Unreal Engine}
Other than Unity’s plugin, the open source and community member developed plugin does not focus on any specific ML algorithm and offers only an API to develop ML projects with TensorFlow. The plugin is under development by just one developer but continuously updated and works with one of the newest versions of TensorFlow but currently only supports Windows. To get started with the plugin, \cite{ue4::tensorFlowPlugin} provides different release build for different engine versions and hardware, documentation about the installation process and the API, and an example project in which the plugin is used to predict hand-written numbers.\\
The installation process of the plugin is pretty straightforward. One downloads a release build from the GitHub page and copies the plugin folders into a \ac{UE4} project. The plugin itself is dependent on two other plugins which are plugins for a Python environment and open socket connections, directly integrated into UE4. After importing the plugins and restart of the project, the Python plugin triggers the installation process to obtain all necessary dependencies for a working ML Python environment. The ML environment is now fully working and usable for development and no external installation is necessary.\\
Setting up an ML environment in UE4 is rather simple and is done in two steps:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{TensorflowComponent}: Add a so-called TensorflowComponent to a UE4 Actor which can communicate and execute a so-called TFPluginAPI Python script. The component itself is a Python scripted UE4 ActorComponent and can only be attached to a UE4 Actor. One might provide some functionality within the component for inputting or outputting data to or from the Python API. The communication uses JSON data, send via an open socket connection to the Python plugin.
	\item \textbf{TFPluginAPI}: Create a Python script which derives from the TFPluginAPI which is a base class script for handling all TensorflowComponent calls. This script can override functions of the TFPluginAPI for setup, input via JSON data, training start and end, and provides functionality to send custom events. ML code goes in the training functions and will be called either by the TensorflowComponent or if deactivated, by a user.
\end{enumerate}
Other than Unity’s procedure, the training process for this plugin does not need a separated environment. The training can happen directly during the game or separately in advance to use an external trained model. Another possibility is to train the model during the game and save it for use in another game session. Every functionality provided by a usual Python API and the TensorFlow framework can be used to develop an ML application within UE4. Furthermore, save and loading functionality of trained models make use of TensorFlow’s specific data format.

\subsection{Conclusion}
Unity’s ML plugin is very focused on implementing ML-agents and provides much code which is more or less useless for the implementation of the PCGML game mechanic. All of their code revolves around implementing an agent with an ML brain, and it would need an overall inspection of their code to set up an own environment to implement the PCGML game mechanic. Furthermore, there are making use of an external Python environment which means that every user would need to set up an own ML environment on their PCs. This fact limits the possible application of a PCGML system implementation to an offline system where the training of the brain happens separately, and the build then includes the pre-trained model.\\
In contrast to Unity’s plugin, the plugin for UE4 is just focused on providing a simple interface to create projects with TensorFlow and has no specific code in its API. The plugin provides and inherits all documentation needed to implement a working project since it uses mainly the TensorFlow framework. Furthermore, there is no necessity of setting up an external environment which makes it possible to include every involved plugin into a fully functional build of a game. Therefore, it is possible to use this plugin for online and offline PCGML systems.\\
These reasons of a basic TensorFlow framework to implement ML algorithms on top of it and that it does not need to set up an external Python and TensorFlow environment drives the decision for the game engine to UE4 with its open source community member developed TensorFlow plugin. Therefore, the rest of this thesis addresses the implementation of a PCGML game mechanic in UE4.

\section{Hardware and Software Requirements}
UE4 itself does not require particular hardware to run. They support many different OS and hardware. This support leads the requirements examination of this chapter on the UE4 TensorFlow plugin.

\subsection{TensorFlow Plugin}
The UE4 TensorFlow plugin currently only supports the Windows OS \cite{ue4::tensorFlowPlugin}. To get started with the plugin, it needs the installation of TensorFlow on the executing system. TensorFlow supports 64-bit and x86 desktops or laptops with Windows 7 or later \cite{api::tensorFlow}. There are two installation options for enabling different types of TensorFlow on the PC:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{\ac{CPU}}: TensorFlow with CPU support is the standard alternative which works for most of the standard PCs in use nowadays. The only significant drawback of using the CPU variant of TensorFlow are longer training1 computation times.
	\item \textbf{\ac{GPU}}: The GPU alternative of TensorFlow offers faster computation of ML algorithms and significantly reduces training time. The only requirement for using the GPU variant is that the user needs to use a GPU which is eligible for NVIDIA's CUDA toolkit \cite{nvidia::cudaToolkit} to run the GPU variant of TensorFlow. Nevertheless, modern PCs with an integrated NVIDIA graphic card are usually eligible to support the CUDA toolkit. 
\end{itemize}
As already mentioned before, the only fundamental difference between the installations is their result in different computation times. Notably, this is getting an important role when the game uses online training and requires suitable computation times for the model's training. For this reason and to avoid initial delays, it is advisable to use a pre-trained model and apply changes to a copy of the model during runtime so that players are not concerned about the computation time.

\section{Data Acquisition}
The most important part of the prototype is about the data to train the ML model. To get a well-trained model, it is most likely that it needs a rather big dataset. For the sake of simplicity of the data search, this dataset size is defined to contain at least 100 entries. However, the right amount of data entries depends on the available variables to train the model, and there is no simple formula for this problem as described in chapter \ref{chapter::machineLearning}. \\
The search for appropriate data starts with the sample and template projects provided in UE4 since its the engine used for the prototype. The templates can offer a significant advantage because they could provide usable data and implementation for the prototype. Unfortunately, these template projects are not eligible, and the search ends with the conclusion of either using real-world data or a games data. The next chapters are going into the detail of all evaluated data sources.

\subsection{Unreal Tournament and Template Project}
Epic Games provide the source code for Unreal Tournament for registered users on their GitHub account \cite{epicGames::unrealTournamentSourceCode}. After following their installation instructions, the project is ready to go and ready for inspection.\\
It shows that Unreal Tournament does not use many weapons as needed for the training. The implementation contains only 16 different weapons with ten common and usable parameters to train the model. Nevertheless, the source code of their weapons and used parameters are the perfect reference or template for implementing an own weapon class.\\
The other starting point for finding appropriate data is the so-called "Shooter Game" project which provides an introduction for implementing FPS games \cite{epicGames::shooterGame}. Unfortunately, this project does not provide any usable data. In fact, it only provides the developer with basic implementation for two different kinds of weapons with an example for each kind of gun. The variables used in their implementation are similar to Unreal Tournament’s weapon parameters.

\subsection{\acl{CS:GO}}
The next point of an initial reference is the favorite eSports game \ac{CS:GO}. Websites about community-driven analysis on the game's central mechanic is the perfect base for finding data appropriate to train an ML model and use the data for weapon generation. Unfortunately, CS:GO does not use many weapons and specializes in 32 weapons for the game \cite{counterstrike::wikiWeapons}. Nevertheless, the provided analysis data provides an excellent base to work with and to extend the available and balanced game data with, e.g., real-world data.

\subsection{Real-World Data}
Plenty of websites about weapons are findable on the \ac{WWW}. However, most of them do not provide much data about the weapon itself. The search leads to, e.g., Army and manufacturer websites to find the appropriate weapon data for specific weapons. Nevertheless, the procedure for finding and obtaining real-world weapon data is a lengthy process. Besides, it shows that weapon manufacturer does not always provide all data, and it would take real-world tests to obtain particular weapon data. In particular, all found weapon data have about 7 to 8 similar variables which are usable for training the model. These parameters are the type of weapon, average weight, overall length, barrel length, bullet caliber, magazine size, muzzle velocity, and the rate of fire.\\
For sure, this data is used to train a model and generate weapons even if this takes more time to implement and balance. However, it would be easier to use already balanced game data to train the model and generate new weapons. For this reason, the search leads to the most valuable data source which is usable for the implementation.

\subsection{TODO: Battlefield 1}
{\color{blue}Investigation showed that the game Battlefield 1, released in 2016, uses more than 100 different weapons in the game. The setting of the game takes place in the World War One and therefore uses weapons of this period. Fortunately, gamers gathered all possible weapon statistics for Battlefield games on the community website "http://symthic.com" \cite{symthic::bf1stats}. They provide a list of all 140 weapons used in the game with very detailed description and statistics \cite{symthic::bf1stats}. In fact, they provide 40 parameters which describe every weapon \cite{symthic::bf1stats}. Further evaluation specializes these parameters to 18 most suitable variables for a weapon implementation. Nevertheless, one can use even more, less or other parameters to generate weapons and train the model and not all of them are always useful. Table \ref{battlefield::weaponStats} shows these most useful parameters for the weapon class and model training. As already indicated, the number of the variables is a subject to change during the implementation.}

\section{TODO: Data Representation - IS THIS REALLY IMPORTANT?}
{\color{blue}the provided data shows that its either sequence or graph data. as described in chapter 5.3.1, they have different advantages and disadvantages but they probably fit both. Compares to the PCGML generation example, it fits better with sequences but the best way to find out is to try both data structures within each method.}

\section{TODO: Learning Methods}


\subsection{The Problem}
{\color{blue}
WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? DESCRIBE IT AND COME UP WITH POSSIBLE LEARNING METHODS!\\
some notes with santi: its not a regression problem. data is provided which is used to generate new but similar data -> its a continuous predicition of connected values and not just 1 prediction value! -> $\vec{x}$ \sout{$(\rightarrow y)$} \\
x = values\\
y = prediction result\\
\\
D -> M -> \boxed{M} -> d\\
Data -> Model -> generated Model -> Density estimation\\
	\\
--> it is about \textbf{density estimation} so that the probability distribution is found for the values/parameters and weapons.\\
--> it is an unsupervised learning problem which should be solvable with generative models.we do have input X but no labels Y.\\
--> generative models are the applicable model for this problem but a discriminative model could also work out\\
 why use what - eg. why use neural network over other and stuff like that!\\
 its a classification and regression problem. use softmax to get probabilities\\
 \\	
As seen throughout the previous chapters, there are no distinctive right or wrong methods to train a model. PCGML is a relatively new approach and many different methods are suitable to reach a certain goal. As the research of \cite{pcgml::paper} shows, methods like \ac{NN}, \ac{LSTM}, autoencoders, deep convolutional networks, markov models or markov chains are applicable for a model's training to generate, e.g., levels of \ac{2D} games. It is worth nothing, that all these mentioned methods are made with the help or resemble \ac{NN} \cite{neuralNetworkZoo}. \\
This common feature is the reason why the implementation decision for the prototype's PCGML training method focuses on a simplified supervised and discriminative method approach with an \ac{ANN} and an unsupervised and generative method approach with a \ac{VAE}. \todo{describe the ideas, how would both of them work?}\\

A simple ANN which is trained on each parameter to predict another one and so forth\\
GANs would also be a possible solution to this problem but there are difficult to train, are generating with a high quality, and the adversarial training probably increase training time.\\
In contrast, VAEs are easy to train, generating blurry results which is perfect, have nice probabilistic, and are easy to introduce.

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are a bio-inspired approach for computational intelligence and machine learning. An ANN is a set of interconnected processing units (named neurons) which was originally designed to model the way a biological brain—containing over $10^{11}$ neurons—processes information, operates, learns and performs in several tasks. Biological neurons have a cell body, a number of dendrites which bring information into the neuron and an axon which transmits electrochemical information outside the neuron. The artificial neuron (see Fig. 2.12) resembles the biological neuron as it has a number of inputs x (corresponding to the neuron dendrites) each with an associated weight parameter w (corresponding to the synaptic strength). It also has a processing unit that combines inputs with their corresponding weights via an inner product (weighted sum) and adds a bias (or threshold) weight b to the weighted sum as follows: $x*w+b$. This value is then fed to an activation function g (cell body) that yields the output of the neuron (corresponding to an axon terminal). ANNs are essentially simple mathematical models defining a function $f : x \rightarrow y$. \cite{ai::book}\\
core applications: pattern recogintion, robot and agent control, game-playing, decision making, gesture, speech and text recognition, medical and financial applications, affective modeling, and image recognition \cite{ai::book}\\
pro: compared to other supervised learning approaches is their capacity to approximate any continuous real-valued function given sufficiently large ANN architectures and computational resources. This capacity characterizes ANNs as universal approximators \cite{ai::book}\\
