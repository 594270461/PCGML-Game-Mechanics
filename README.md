# Using Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning as a Game Mechanic
This repository is all about my master thesis addressing the open problem "Using Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning as a Game Mechanic," and written for the study program "Game Engineering and Simulation Technologies" at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien, Vienna, Austria.
Summerville et al. initially introduced the concept of using PCGML for, e.g., level generation and also other application. One leading open issue stated in the paper about PCGML is the use of PCGMl as a game mechanic which is addressed by this thesis.

# Breakdown
There will be two main projects in this repository:
- The master thesis, written in LaTeX
- A prototype game which uses Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) as a game mechanic
