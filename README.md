# PCGML-GameMechanics
This repository is all about my master thesis about "Using Procedural Content Generation via Machine Learning (PCGML) as a Game Mechanic" at the University of Applied Sciences Technikum Wien. The concept of using PCGML was initially introduced by Summerville et al. and some issues like the use of PCGMl as a game mechanic were left open which is the reason for this thesis.
